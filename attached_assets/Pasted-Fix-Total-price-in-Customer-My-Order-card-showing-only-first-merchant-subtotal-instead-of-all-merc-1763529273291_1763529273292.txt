Fix Total price in Customer My Order card - showing only first merchant subtotal instead of all merchants:

PROBLEM:

In Customer > My Orders card for multi-merchant order:

CURRENT (WRONG):
- Mcdo Subtotal: ₱74.75 ✓
- Jollibee Subtotal: ₱60.50 ✓
- Total: ₱74.75 ✗ (only showing Mcdo subtotal)
- Delivery Fee: ₱160.00 ✓
- Grand Total: ₱335.25 ✓

REQUIRED (CORRECT):
- Mcdo Subtotal: ₱74.75 ✓
- Jollibee Subtotal: ₱60.50 ✓
- Total: ₱135.25 ✓ (sum of both merchants)
- Delivery Fee: ₱160.00 ✓
- Grand Total: ₱335.25 ✓

ISSUE:

The "Total:" line (items subtotal) is only showing the first merchant's subtotal (₱74.75) instead of the sum of all merchants (₱74.75 + ₱60.50 = ₱135.25).

FIX REQUIRED:

1. LOCATE THE CALCULATION:
   
   In Customer My Orders card component, find where "Total:" is calculated.
   
   Current (wrong):
```javascript
   // Showing only first merchant
   total = firstMerchant.subtotal  // ₱74.75
```
   
   Required (correct):
```javascript
   // Sum all merchants
   total = merchants.reduce((sum, merchant) => sum + merchant.subtotal, 0)
   // ₱74.75 + ₱60.50 = ₱135.25
```

2. VERIFY BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE:
   
   For multi-merchant orders:
   
   Merchant 1 Subtotal: ₱74.75
   Merchant 2 Subtotal: ₱60.50
   ─────────────────────────────
   Total (Items): ₱135.25  ← Sum of all merchant subtotals
   Delivery Fee: ₱160.00
   Multi-Merchant Fee: ₱20.00 (if shown)
   Rider's Convenience Fee: ₱20.00 (if shown)
   ─────────────────────────────
   Grand Total: ₱335.25

3. CALCULATION LOGIC:
```javascript
   // Calculate items total (sum of all merchants)
   const itemsTotal = orderMerchants.reduce((sum, merchant) => {
     return sum + merchant.subtotal;
   }, 0);
   
   // Then add fees
   const grandTotal = itemsTotal + deliveryFee + multiFee + convenienceFee;
```

4. DISPLAY:
   
   Show clear hierarchy:
   - Individual merchant subtotals (grouped by merchant)
   - Total: (sum of all merchant subtotals)
   - Fees (delivery, multi-merchant, convenience)
   - Grand Total: (everything combined)

5. CHECK DATA SOURCE:
   
   Verify the order data structure:
   - Is total_amount correctly calculated in database?
   - Is items_subtotal the sum of all merchants?
   - Or is it only storing first merchant's subtotal?

6. ENSURE CONSISTENCY:
   
   This should match the checkout calculation:
   - Checkout shows ₱135.25 for items total
   - My Orders should show same ₱135.25 for items total
   - Not just ₱74.75 from first merchant

The "Total:" line should sum ALL merchant subtotals, not just the first one. Fix the calculation to iterate through all merchants and sum their subtotals.
