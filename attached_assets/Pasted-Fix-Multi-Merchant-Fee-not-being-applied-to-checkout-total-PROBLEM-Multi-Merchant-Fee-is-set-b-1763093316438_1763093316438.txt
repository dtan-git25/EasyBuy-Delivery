Fix Multi-Merchant Fee not being applied to checkout total:

PROBLEM:
Multi-Merchant Fee is set by admin but not being added to the total order price in checkout modal.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. WHEN TO APPLY:
   - ONLY for orders with 2 or more different merchants
   - Do NOT apply for single merchant orders
   - Applied once per order, not per merchant

2. HOW TO CALCULATE:
   - Count unique merchants in cart
   - If merchant_count >= 2: Add Multi-Merchant Fee
   - If merchant_count = 1: No fee

3. ADMIN SETTING:
   - Setting name: Multi-Merchant Fee
   - Type: Fixed peso amount
   - Example: ₱20
   - Description: "Fee charged per additional merchant when customer orders from 2 or more merchants"
   - Location: Settings > Multi-Merchant Checkout

4. CHECKOUT DISPLAY ORDER:

   Single Merchant Order (NO fee):
   Items Subtotal: ₱500.00
   Delivery Fee (4 km): ₱100.00
   Convenience Fee: ₱15.00
   Rider's Commission: ₱20.00
   TOTAL: ₱635.00

   Multi-Merchant Order (fee applied):
   Items Subtotal: ₱500.00
   Delivery Fee (4 km): ₱100.00
   Multi-Merchant Fee: ₱20.00  ← Shows BEFORE Convenience Fee
   Convenience Fee: ₱15.00
   Rider's Commission: ₱20.00
   TOTAL: ₱655.00

5. LINE POSITION:
   Multi-Merchant Fee line must appear:
   - After Delivery Fee
   - BEFORE Convenience Fee
   - Before Rider's Commission
   - Before Total

6. CALCULATION IN TOTAL:
   
   Single Merchant:
   Total = Items + Delivery Fee + Convenience Fee + Rider's Commission
   
   Multi-Merchant:
   Total = Items + Delivery Fee + Multi-Merchant Fee + Convenience Fee + Rider's Commission

7. VERIFICATION:
   Check in checkout logic:
   - Count merchants: Get unique merchant IDs from cart
   - If count >= 2: Include Multi-Merchant Fee in total
   - If count = 1: Exclude Multi-Merchant Fee

8. DISPLAY LOGIC:
   - Only show Multi-Merchant Fee line if fee applies
   - Don't show line for single merchant orders
   - Always show if 2+ merchants in order

9. REVENUE ALLOCATION:
   Multi-Merchant Fee goes to: App (100%)
   This compensates for additional complexity of multi-merchant coordination.

Fix the checkout calculation to properly include Multi-Merchant Fee in the total when customer orders from multiple merchants.
