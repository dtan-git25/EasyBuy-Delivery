Export menu_groups and menu_group_items table schemas to migration file for Git:

SITUATION:

We are in DEV environment. The menu_groups and menu_group_items tables already exist in the dev database and are working. We need to export these table schemas to a migration file so they can be pushed to Git and applied to production.

REQUIREMENT:

Create a migration file containing the CREATE TABLE statements for:
1. menu_groups table
2. menu_group_items table

STEPS:

1. EXPORT TABLE SCHEMAS FROM DEV DATABASE:

   Generate the CREATE TABLE statements for both tables with their:
   - Column definitions
   - Data types
   - Primary keys
   - Foreign keys
   - Indexes
   - Constraints

2. CREATE MIGRATION FILE:

   Create file: `/db/migrations/002_create_menu_groups.sql`
   
   Include:
```sql
   -- Migration: Create menu groups tables
   -- Date: 2025-01-17
   -- Description: Add menu groups feature for merchant menu organization
   
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS menu_groups (
     -- Add all columns, keys, indexes from existing table
   );
   
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS menu_group_items (
     -- Add all columns, keys, indexes from existing table
   );
```

3. EXTRACT EXACT SCHEMA:

   Get the actual schema from dev database:
   - Show the EXACT structure of menu_groups table
   - Show the EXACT structure of menu_group_items table
   - Include all columns, types, constraints, indexes
   - Use IF NOT EXISTS to make it safe to run multiple times

4. VERIFY MIGRATION FILE:

   Ensure the migration file:
   - Has correct SQL syntax
   - Includes all necessary constraints
   - Can be run safely in production
   - Won't conflict with existing tables

5. SAVE TO GIT:

   After creating the migration file:
   - It will be tracked in Git
   - Can be committed
   - Will be pushed to GitHub
   - Can be run in production

Generate the complete CREATE TABLE statements for menu_groups and menu_group_items from the existing dev database and save them to a migration file that can be committed to Git.

This way, when we push to GitHub and pull in production, we'll have the schema to create these tables.
