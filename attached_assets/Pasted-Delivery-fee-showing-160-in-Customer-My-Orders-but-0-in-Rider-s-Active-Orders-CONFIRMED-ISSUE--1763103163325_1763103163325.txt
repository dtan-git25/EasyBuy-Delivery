Delivery fee showing ₱160 in Customer My Orders but ₱0 in Rider's Active Orders:

CONFIRMED ISSUE:

Customer My Orders shows:
- Delivery Fee: ₱160.00 ✓ (correct)

Rider's Active Orders shows:
- Delivery Fee: ₱0.00 ✗ (wrong - should be ₱160.00)

Same order, different delivery fee values displayed.

PROBLEM:

The delivery fee IS saved in the order (₱160), but rider's query is not fetching it correctly or displaying wrong field.

DEBUGGING STEPS:

1. CHECK RIDER'S QUERY:
   When fetching active orders for rider, verify:
   - Is delivery_fee included in SELECT statement?
   - Log the query results: console.log('Rider active orders:', orders)
   - Check if delivery_fee field exists in returned data
   - What value does it have?

2. CHECK FIELD MAPPING:
   - Customer view uses: order.delivery_fee → shows ₱160 ✓
   - Rider view uses: ??? → shows ₱0 ✗
   - Are they using the same field name?
   - Is rider view using wrong field or default value?

3. VERIFY DATABASE:
   - Check orders table for this specific order
   - ORDER ID: GROUP-d2620e16-9048-4326-afd2-a0fe4adbf240
   - What is the delivery_fee value in database?
   - Should be 160

4. CHECK RIDER COMPONENT:
   In Rider's Active Order card component:
   - Find where "Delivery Fee:" line is rendered
   - What variable is it displaying?
   - Is it using: order.delivery_fee or deliveryFee or something else?
   - Why is it showing 0?

LIKELY ISSUE:

Rider's active orders query is either:
- Not fetching delivery_fee from database
- Fetching it but using wrong field name in display
- Using a default/fallback value of 0

FIX REQUIRED:

1. Ensure rider's query includes delivery_fee:
   SELECT orders.*, delivery_fee, delivery_distance FROM orders WHERE rider_id = ?

2. Display correct field in rider view:
   Use same field that customer view uses (which works correctly)

3. Test with this specific order:
   - Order: GROUP-d2620e16-9048-4326-afd2-a0fe4adbf240
   - Should show ₱160.00 in both customer and rider views

The data exists (customer sees it), so rider view just needs to fetch/display the correct field.
