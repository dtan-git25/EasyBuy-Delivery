Fix Grand Total calculation error in Customer My Orders and Rider Active Orders:

In Order #GROUP-7351f024-43a0-4fa0-927e-86a27f90af27

PROBLEM:

Both Customer My Orders card and Rider Active Orders card showing WRONG Grand Total.

CORRECT CALCULATION:
- Items Total: ₱120.00
- Markup: ₱15.25
- Delivery Fee: ₱160.00
- Multi-Merchant Fee: ₱20.00
- Rider's Convenience Fee: ₱10.00
─────────────────────────
CORRECT TOTAL: ₱325.25

CURRENT (WRONG):
- Shows: ₱335.25 ✗
- Difference: ₱10.00 extra

DEBUGGING:

1. CHECK CALCULATION:
   
   Verify the total calculation:
   ₱120.00 (items) + ₱15.25 (markup) + ₱160.00 (delivery) + ₱20.00 (multi) + ₱10.00 (convenience)
   = ₱325.25 ✓
   
   Current shows ₱335.25 = ₱10 overcharged

2. LIKELY CAUSES:
   
   A. Double-counting a fee:
   - Rider's Convenience Fee added twice?
   - Multi-Merchant Fee added twice?
   - Some ₱10 fee counted twice
   
   B. Extra fee being added:
   - Unknown ₱10 charge
   - Old fee not removed from calculation
   
   C. Wrong field being summed:
   - Using wrong total from database
   - Calculation includes extra amount

3. CHECK CALCULATION CODE:
   
   Find where Grand Total / Total to Collect is calculated:
   
   Should be:
```javascript
   grandTotal = itemsTotal + markup + deliveryFee + multiMerchantFee + convenienceFee
   grandTotal = 120 + 15.25 + 160 + 20 + 10 = 325.25
```
   
   Currently calculating:
```javascript
   grandTotal = ??? = 335.25
```

4. VERIFY BREAKDOWN:
   
   Log each component:
```javascript
   console.log('Items Total:', itemsTotal); // Should be 120
   console.log('Markup:', markup); // Should be 15.25
   console.log('Delivery Fee:', deliveryFee); // Should be 160
   console.log('Multi-Merchant Fee:', multiMerchantFee); // Should be 20
   console.log('Convenience Fee:', convenienceFee); // Should be 10
   console.log('Grand Total:', grandTotal); // Should be 325.25
   console.log('Actual showing:', displayedTotal); // Shows 335.25
```

5. CHECK DATABASE:
   
   Query this order:
   - What is stored as total_amount?
   - Is it ₱335.25 (wrong) or ₱325.25 (correct)?
   - If database has wrong amount, fix order creation logic

6. FIX IN BOTH PLACES:
   
   Customer My Orders card:
   - Grand Total: ₱325.25
   
   Rider Active Orders card:
   - Total to Collect from Customer: ₱325.25

7. VERIFY CHECKOUT:
   
   Check if checkout also showed ₱335.25 (wrong) or ₱325.25 (correct):
   - If checkout was correct (₱325.25), then display is wrong
   - If checkout was wrong (₱335.25), then calculation is wrong from start


The ₱10 difference suggests either Rider's Convenience Fee (₱10) is being added twice, or there's an extra ₱10 fee being included that shouldn't be.

Find the calculation code and ensure it sums: Items + Markup + Delivery + Multi-Merchant + Convenience = ₱325.25

Currently it's adding ₱10 extra somewhere.
