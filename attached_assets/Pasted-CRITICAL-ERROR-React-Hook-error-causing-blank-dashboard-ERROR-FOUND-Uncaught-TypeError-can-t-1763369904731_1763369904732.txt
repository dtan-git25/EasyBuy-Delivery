CRITICAL ERROR - React Hook error causing blank dashboard:

ERROR FOUND:

"Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "useState", dispatcher is null"

"Warning: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component."

This is happening in:
- use-toast.ts:172
- use-auth.tsx:24

ROOT CAUSE:

There's likely a React Hook being called incorrectly or outside of a component. This breaks the entire app.

IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED:

1. CHECK use-toast.ts FILE:
   - Line 172 is calling useState
   - Is this hook being called outside a component?
   - Is it being called conditionally?
   - Is the file structure correct?

2. CHECK use-auth.tsx FILE:
   - Line 24 is calling useToast
   - This is triggering the error
   - Verify the component structure

3. LIKELY ISSUES:

   Issue A: Hook called outside component
   - useState or useToast called at file level
   - Must be inside function component body

   Issue B: Conditional hook call
   - Hook called inside if statement
   - Hooks must be called unconditionally

   Issue C: Multiple React versions
   - Check if there are duplicate React packages
   - Run: npm ls react
   - Should only have one version

4. COMMON PATTERNS TO CHECK:

   WRONG:
const toast = useToast(); // Called outside component
export const AuthProvider = () => {
return <div>...</div>
}

   CORRECT:
export const AuthProvider = () => {
const toast = useToast(); // Called inside component
return <div>...</div>
}

5. VERIFY COMPONENT STRUCTURE:

   In use-auth.tsx, ensure:
   - AuthProvider is a proper function component
   - useToast is called inside the component body
   - Not called before return statement setup

6. CHECK FOR ACCIDENTAL CHANGES:

   Did the recent Earnings History changes modify:
   - use-toast.ts file?
   - use-auth.tsx file?
   - Any shared hooks or utilities?

7. ROLLBACK STRATEGY:

   If you can't immediately identify the issue:
   - Revert ALL changes made for Earnings History
   - Get the app working again
   - Then re-implement carefully

8. FIX THE HOOK CALL:

   Find where useState or useToast is being called incorrectly and move it inside the component function body at the top level (not nested in conditions).

This is a critical React error that breaks the entire app. The hook is being called in the wrong place or wrong way. Check use-toast.ts line 172 and use-auth.tsx line 24 immediately.
