Product options STILL not showing in cart and checkout after fix attempt:

CRITICAL DEBUGGING NEEDED:

The options are not displaying. We need to identify where the issue is in the data flow.

1. CHECK IF OPTIONS ARE SAVED TO CART:
   When customer selects options and adds to cart:
   - Log what data is being saved: console.log('Adding to cart:', cartItemData)
   - Check if selected options are included in cart item data
   - Verify options array/object is not empty

2. CHECK CART DATA STRUCTURE:
   When cart is displayed:
   - Log cart items: console.log('Cart items:', cartItems)
   - Check if each cart item has options data
   - See the actual structure of saved options

3. CHECK IF OPTIONS ARE IN DATABASE:
   If cart is stored in database:
   - Query the cart items table
   - Check if options column has data
   - Verify the data format is correct

4. CHECK RENDERING LOGIC:
   In cart modal component:
   - Find where cart items are mapped/rendered
   - Check if there's code to display options
   - Verify it's actually trying to render options

5. COMMON ISSUES:
   - Options selected but not saved to cart data
   - Options saved but wrong data structure
   - Options in cart but not being rendered in UI
   - Wrong field name (looking for "options" but saved as "customizations")

6. ADD EXTENSIVE LOGGING:
   
   When adding to cart:
   console.log('Selected options:', selectedOptions)
   console.log('Cart item with options:', cartItem)
   
   When displaying cart:
   console.log('Rendering cart item:', item)
   console.log('Item options:', item.options)
   
   Share these console logs so we can see the actual data.

7. VERIFY COMPLETE FLOW:
   - Customer selects: Size = Medium
   - Customer clicks Add to Cart
   - Check: Is Size = Medium saved?
   - Customer opens cart
   - Check: Does cart data include Size = Medium?
   - Cart renders
   - Check: Is Size = Medium displayed?

8. TEST WITH SIMPLE EXAMPLE:
   - Add item with just ONE option selected
   - Log every step
   - See where the option data gets lost

Without seeing the actual data in console logs, we're guessing. Add logging at every step and share what appears in console.

Where exactly is the data being lost - during selection, during save, or during display?
