Replace Rider Commission (%) with App Earnings and update the formula:

CHANGES:

1. RENAME IN ADMIN SETTINGS:
   Change "Rider Commission (%)" to "App Earnings (%)"
   
   Description: "Percentage of delivery fee that the app earns, plus all order markup"

2. NEW FORMULA:
   App Earnings = (Total Delivery Fee × App Earnings %) + Total Order Markup
   
   Example:
   - Delivery Fee: ₱100
   - App Earnings %: 50%
   - Order Markup: ₱10
   - App Earnings = (₱100 × 50%) + ₱10 = ₱50 + ₱10 = ₱60

3. RIDER EARNINGS:
   Rider Earnings = Total Delivery Fee - (Delivery Fee × App Earnings %)
   
   Using same example:
   - Delivery Fee: ₱100
   - App takes: ₱50 (50% of ₱100)
   - Rider gets: ₱50

4. COMPLETE ORDER BREAKDOWN:
   
   Customer pays:
   - Items: ₱500
   - Delivery Fee: ₱100
   - Total: ₱600
   
   With 10% markup and 50% app earnings:
   - Markup on items: ₱50
   - App gets from delivery: ₱50 (50% of ₱100)
   - App gets from markup: ₱50
   - Total App Earnings: ₱100
   - Rider gets: ₱50 (remaining 50% of delivery fee)
   - Merchant gets: ₱500 (base item price)

5. UPDATE IN:
   - Admin settings page (rename field)
   - Order calculations (new formula)
   - Admin reports (show as App Earnings)
   - Rider earnings display (delivery fee minus app percentage)
   - Database fields (rename or add new)

6. ADMIN SETTINGS UI:
   App Earnings (%)
   [50] %
   
   "The percentage of delivery fee the app earns. The app also earns all order markup."
   
   Preview:
   If delivery fee is ₱100 and markup is ₱10:
   - App earns: ₱60 (50% of ₱100 + ₱10 markup)
   - Rider earns: ₱50 (50% of ₱100)

7. RIDER EARNINGS PAGE:
   Show:
   - Total Deliveries: 10 orders
   - Gross Delivery Fees: ₱1,000
   - App Share: ₱500 (50%)
   - Net Earnings: ₱500

8. ADMIN REPORTS:
   Show:
   - Total Delivery Fees Collected: ₱XXX
   - App Earnings from Delivery: ₱XXX (% of delivery fees)
   - App Earnings from Markup: ₱XXX
   - Total App Earnings: ₱XXX
   - Total Rider Earnings: ₱XXX

This makes it clear that the app earns a percentage of delivery fees plus all markup, while riders get the remaining percentage of delivery fees.
