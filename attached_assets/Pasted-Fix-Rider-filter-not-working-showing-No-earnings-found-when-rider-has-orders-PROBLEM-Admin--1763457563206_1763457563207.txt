Fix Rider filter not working - showing "No earnings found" when rider has orders:

PROBLEM:

Admin > Reports > Earnings History:
- Selected "Rider 1" from dropdown
- Shows: "No earnings found for selected period"
- But Rider 1 has 8 completed orders

DEBUGGING NEEDED:

1. CHECK FILTER QUERY:
   When rider is selected, verify the database query:
   - Is rider_id being passed correctly?
   - Is the WHERE clause correct?
   - Log the query: console.log('Filtering by rider:', riderId)
   - Log results: console.log('Found orders:', orders)

2. CHECK RIDER ID VALUE:
   - What value is being sent when "Rider 1" is selected?
   - Is it the correct rider ID from database?
   - Is it numeric or string?
   - Type mismatch issue? (e.g., "1" vs 1)

3. CHECK QUERY STRUCTURE:
   
   Should be:
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE rider_id = ?
AND status IN ('completed', 'cancelled')
AND created_at BETWEEN ? AND ?

   Verify:
   - rider_id field exists in orders table
   - rider_id matches between dropdown value and database
   - No type conversion issues

4. CHECK DROPDOWN VALUE:
   
   When selecting "Rider 1":
   - What value is captured? Log it
   - Is it the rider's database ID?
   - Or rider name/username?
   - Must match rider_id in orders table

5. CHECK DATE RANGE:
   - Current filter: "Last 30 Days"
   - Are all 8 orders within last 30 days?
   - Try "All Time" to see if orders appear

6. CHECK ORDER STATUS:
   - Are orders status = 'completed'?
   - Or different status?
   - Verify query includes correct statuses

7. COMPARE WITH MERCHANT FILTER:
   - Merchant filter works correctly
   - Use same query pattern for rider filter
   - Check if logic is identical

8. TEST QUERY DIRECTLY:
   
   Run query in database:
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE rider_id = 1 AND status = 'completed'
   
   Do results appear?
   - Yes: Filter implementation issue
   - No: Data issue or wrong rider_id

9. VERIFY RIDER-ORDER RELATIONSHIP:
   
   Check orders table:
   - Do the 8 orders have rider_id = 1?
   - Or different rider_id value?
   - Verify relationship is correct

10. CHECK API ENDPOINT:
    
    Admin earnings history API:
    - Is rider filter parameter being received?
    - Is it being applied to query?
    - Log request parameters

Add extensive logging to identify where the filter is failing and share the console output.
