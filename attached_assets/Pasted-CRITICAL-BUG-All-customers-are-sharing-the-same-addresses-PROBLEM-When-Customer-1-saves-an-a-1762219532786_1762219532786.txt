CRITICAL BUG - All customers are sharing the same addresses!

PROBLEM:
When Customer 1 saves an address (Capas), Customer 2 automatically gets that same address in their saved addresses. All customers are seeing each other's addresses.

This is a SEVERE data privacy and security issue.

ROOT CAUSE:
The customer_addresses or addresses table is NOT properly filtering by customer_id, or addresses are being saved without a customer_id.

IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED:

1. CHECK ADDRESS SAVING:
   When a customer saves an address, ensure it's saved WITH their customer_id:
   - Address must be linked to specific customer
   - customer_id must be included in the insert
   - Verify customer_id is not null or default value

2. CHECK ADDRESS FETCHING:
   When displaying saved addresses, ensure query filters by logged-in customer:
   - Must filter: WHERE customer_id = current_user_id
   - NOT fetching all addresses from table
   - Only show addresses belonging to that specific customer

3. CHECK CHECKOUT ADDRESS SELECTION:
   Same issue - ensure only showing addresses for current customer:
   - Filter by customer_id
   - Customer should only see their own addresses
   - Not all addresses in system

4. VERIFY DATABASE:
   Check the addresses table:
   - Does it have customer_id column?
   - Are addresses being saved with correct customer_id?
   - Or are all addresses saved with null or same customer_id?

5. PRIVACY VIOLATION:
   This means:
   - Customers can see other customers' home addresses
   - Customers can select other people's addresses for delivery
   - Serious privacy and security breach
   - Must be fixed immediately

6. TEST THE FIX:
   After fixing:
   - Create Customer A, save Address 1
   - Create Customer B, check saved addresses
   - Customer B should have NO addresses
   - Customer B saves Address 2
   - Customer A should still only see Address 1
   - Customer B should only see Address 2

This is a critical bug that must be fixed before any real customers use the system. Every customer must only see and use their own saved addresses.
