Three updates for Customer portal:

1. ADD "NONE" OPTION TO ALL CUSTOMIZATION TYPES:

When customer customizes menu item order:
- For EVERY option type that merchant added (Size, Flavor, Add-ons, etc.)
- Automatically include "None" as the first option
- Customer can choose to skip that customization

Example:
Merchant added for Fries:
- Size: Small (₱50), Large (₱75)
- Add-ons: Extra Cheese (₱20), Bacon (₱25)

Customer sees:
Size:
○ None (₱0)
○ Small (₱50)
○ Large (₱75)

Add-ons:
□ None (₱0)
□ Extra Cheese (₱20)
□ Bacon (₱25)

Implementation:
- "None" option should have ₱0 price
- "None" should be pre-selected by default for optional customizations
- If customization is required (merchant marked as required), "None" can be disabled or hidden
- For radio button options (single choice): "None" is first option
- For checkboxes (multiple choice): "None" checkbox available

Price calculation:
- If customer selects "None", add ₱0 to item price
- If customer selects actual option, add that option's price
- Display total: Base price + selected options

2. REMOVE DELIVERY FEE AND CONVINIECE FEE FROM CART MODAL:

Keep cart simple - just items and subtotal.

3. DELIVERY FEE CALCULATION IN CHECKOUT MODAL:

Calculate delivery fee when checkout opens:
- Get customer coordinates (from selected delivery address)
- Get merchant coordinates (from store location)
- Use Haversine formula to calculate distance in km
- Get admin settings: base_rate (first km), succeeding_rate (per km)
- Apply formula:
```
  roundedDistance = Math.ceil(actualDistance)
  if (roundedDistance <= 1):
    deliveryFee = baseRate
  else:
    deliveryFee = baseRate + ((roundedDistance - 1) × succeedingRate)
```

Real-time updates:
- If customer edits address/changes pin location
- Recalculate distance immediately
- Update delivery fee
- Update total
- No page refresh needed


These three changes improve customization flexibility, simplify cart view, and ensure accurate delivery fee calculation based on real GPS coordinates.
