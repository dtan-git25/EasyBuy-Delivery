Logo upload failing but merchant and menu item photos upload successfully to Cloudinary:

PROBLEM:

- ✅ Merchant photos: Upload to Cloudinary successfully
- ✅ Menu item photos: Upload to Cloudinary successfully  
- ❌ App logo: Fails to upload (folder created but no image)

This indicates:
- Cloudinary credentials are correct (other uploads work)
- Cloudinary connection works (other uploads succeed)
- Issue is SPECIFIC to logo upload endpoint

DEBUGGING:

1. COMPARE WORKING VS BROKEN ENDPOINTS:
   
   Find the three upload endpoints:
   
   A. Logo upload (BROKEN):
      - POST /api/admin/upload-logo (or similar path)
   
   B. Merchant photo upload (WORKING):
      - POST /api/merchants/upload-photo (or similar)
   
   C. Menu item photo upload (WORKING):
      - POST /api/menu-items/upload-photo (or similar)
   
   Compare the implementations - what's different?

2. CHECK LOGO UPLOAD IMPLEMENTATION:
   
   The logo upload likely has different code than the working uploads.
   
   Common differences:
   - Different multer configuration
   - Different Cloudinary upload parameters
   - Different error handling
   - Different file processing

3. COPY WORKING PATTERN:
   
   Since merchant/menu uploads work, use the SAME pattern for logo:
   
   Find the working merchant photo upload code and replicate it for logo upload.
   
   If merchant upload does:
```javascript
   const result = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(req.file.path, {
     folder: `easybuydelivery-dev/merchants/${merchantId}`,
     ...options
   });
```
   
   Logo upload should do:
```javascript
   const result = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(req.file.path, {
     folder: 'easybuydelivery-dev/logos',
     public_id: 'logo',
     overwrite: true
   });
```

4. CHECK MULTER CONFIGURATION:
   
   Logo upload might use different multer setup:
   
   Compare:
   - Is logo using same multer instance as other uploads?
   - Same storage configuration?
   - Same file size limits?
   - Same allowed formats?

5. CHECK FILE FIELD NAME:
   
   Verify frontend sends correct field name:
   - Frontend might send: `<input name="logo" />`
   - Backend expects: `upload.single('logo')`
   - Field names must match exactly

6. CHECK ROUTE DEFINITION:
   
   Logo upload route might have issues:
```javascript
   // Check if multer middleware is applied
   app.post('/api/admin/upload-logo', 
     upload.single('logo'),  // ← Is this here?
     async (req, res) => {
       console.log('req.file:', req.file); // ← Is this defined?
       // ...
     }
   );
```

7. ADD LOGGING TO LOGO UPLOAD:
   
   Add same logging that works in merchant/menu uploads:
```javascript
   console.log('Logo upload - file received:', req.file);
   console.log('Logo upload - uploading to Cloudinary...');
   const result = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(...);
   console.log('Logo upload - success:', result.secure_url);
```

8. CHECK RESPONSE HANDLING:
   
   Logo upload might not return/save URL correctly:
   - Does it return the Cloudinary URL?
   - Does it save to database?
   - Check what response is sent to frontend

9. LIKELY ISSUES:
   
   A. Different multer configuration for logo
   B. Missing upload.single() middleware
   C. Wrong file field name
   D. Different upload method (not using working pattern)
   E. Error swallowed/not logged
   F. Database save failing (but upload succeeds)

10. QUICK FIX:
    
    Copy-paste the WORKING merchant photo upload code and modify for logo:
```javascript
    // Find the working merchant upload endpoint
    // Copy the entire function
    // Change:
    // - folder: 'easybuydelivery-dev/logos'
    // - public_id: 'logo'
    // - database save: settings table instead of merchants
    // - Keep everything else the same
```

Share the code for:
1. Logo upload endpoint (the broken one)
2. Merchant photo upload endpoint (the working one)

This will show the difference causing the logo upload to fail.

The fact that merchant/menu uploads work proves Cloudinary is configured correctly - logo upload just needs to use the same working pattern.
