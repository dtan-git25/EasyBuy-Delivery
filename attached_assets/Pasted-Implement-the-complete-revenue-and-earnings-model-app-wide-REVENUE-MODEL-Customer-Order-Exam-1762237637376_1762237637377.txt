Implement the complete revenue and earnings model app-wide:

REVENUE MODEL:

Customer Order Example:
- Items (base cost): ₱500
- Order Markup: ₱10
- Delivery Fee: ₱100
- Convenience Fee: ₱15
- CUSTOMER PAYS TOTAL: ₱625

Revenue Distribution:
1. Merchant Earnings: ₱500 (base items cost)
2. App Earnings: ₱60 (calculated as: (Delivery Fee × App Earnings %) + Total Markup)
3. Rider Earnings: ₱65 (calculated as: (Delivery Fee × (100% - App Earnings %)) + Convenience Fee)

Using Admin Settings:
- App Earnings %: 50% (configurable by admin)
- Convenience Fee: ₱15 (configurable by admin)

Calculations:
- App Earnings = (₱100 × 50%) + ₱10 = ₱50 + ₱10 = ₱60
- Rider Earnings = (₱100 × 50%) + ₱15 = ₱50 + ₱15 = ₱65

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED:

1. ADMIN SETTINGS PAGE:
   Add two configurable settings:
   
   App Earnings (%)
   Input: [50] %
   Description: "Percentage of delivery fee that the app earns. Remaining percentage goes to rider. App also earns all order markup."
   
   Convenience Fee
   Input: ₱[15]
   Description: "Fixed amount rider earns per delivery in addition to their delivery fee share."
   
   Show preview calculation based on example delivery fee.

2. ORDER CALCULATIONS:
   For every order, calculate and store:
   - items_subtotal (base merchant price)
   - order_markup (markup amount on items)
   - delivery_fee (distance-based calculation)
   - convenience_fee (from admin settings)
   - app_earnings = (delivery_fee × app_earnings_percentage) + order_markup
   - rider_earnings = (delivery_fee × (1 - app_earnings_percentage)) + convenience_fee
   - merchant_earnings = items_subtotal
   - total_amount = items_subtotal + order_markup + delivery_fee + convenience_fee

3. CUSTOMER CHECKOUT DISPLAY:
   Show breakdown:
   Items Subtotal: ₱500.00
   Delivery Fee: ₱100.00
   Convenience Fee: ₱15.00
