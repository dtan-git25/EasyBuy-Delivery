Implement Capacity-Based Rider Booking System with numeric limits:

ADMIN SETTINGS (Settings tab > Rider Management or Multi-Merchant Checkout section):

Create "Rider Booking Capacity" settings card with two controls:

1. MAXIMUM ACTIVE ORDERS
   - Label: "Maximum Active Orders Per Rider"
   - Control type: Number input or slider
   - Range: 1 to 10, or "Unlimited" option
   - Default: Unlimited
   - Description: "Maximum number of orders a rider can accept simultaneously"

2. MAXIMUM MERCHANTS PER ORDER
   - Label: "Maximum Merchants Per Order"
   - Control type: Number input or slider
   - Range: 1 to 5, or "Unlimited" option
   - Default: Unlimited
   - Description: "Maximum number of merchants allowed in a single order"

HOW IT WORKS:

Maximum Active Orders Examples:
- Set to 1: Rider must complete current order before accepting another
- Set to 2: Rider can handle 2 orders simultaneously, then locked until one completes
- Set to 5: Rider can juggle up to 5 orders at once
- Set to Unlimited: No restriction on order count

Maximum Merchants Per Order Examples:
- Set to 1: Orders with multiple merchants are hidden from riders or cannot be accepted
- Set to 3: Riders can only accept orders with 3 or fewer merchants
- Set to 5: Riders can accept orders with up to 5 merchants
- Set to Unlimited: Riders can accept orders regardless of merchant count

VALIDATION LOGIC:

When rider tries to accept an order:

Step 1 - Check Active Order Limit:
- Count rider's current active orders
- If count >= max active orders setting, block acceptance
- Show message: "You have reached the maximum of [X] active orders. Complete an order first."

Step 2 - Check Merchant Count Limit:
- Count number of merchants in the pending order
- If merchant count > max merchants setting, block acceptance
- Show message: "This order contains [X] merchants. Maximum allowed is [Y] merchants per order."

Step 3 - Allow acceptance if both checks pass

RIDER PENDING ORDERS DISPLAY:

Show order information:
- Customer name
- Store names (if multiple)
- Merchant count indicator: "3 pickups" or "2 merchants"
- Total amount
- Accept button (disabled if restrictions prevent acceptance)

If order cannot be accepted due to restrictions:
- Disable Accept button
- Show tooltip explaining why
- "Complete your active orders first (2/2 active)"
- "Too many merchants (5 merchants, max 3 allowed)"

ADMIN UI LAYOUT:

Rider Booking Capacity Settings

Maximum Active Orders Per Rider:
○ 1 order   ○ 2 orders   ○ 3 orders   ○ 5 orders   ○ Unlimited
or
[Number input: 2] [Apply]

Maximum Merchants Per Order:
○ 1 merchant   ○ 2 merchants   ○ 3 merchants   ○ 5 merchants   ○ Unlimited
or
[Number input: 3] [Apply]

Preview:
With current settings, riders can accept up to 2 orders simultaneously, each containing up to 3 merchants maximum.

DATABASE STRUCTURE:

admin_settings table:
- max_active_orders_per_rider (integer, null = unlimited)
- max_merchants_per_order (integer, null = unlimited)

orders table already has:
- merchant_count (count of merchants in order)
- rider_id
- status

BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH:

1. Simple and Clear:
   - No confusing toggle combinations
   - Just set two numbers
   - Easy to understand impact

2. Flexible:
   - Admin can fine-tune based on their market
   - Can adjust as business grows
   - Can test different capacities

3. Scalable:
   - Works for small operations (strict limits)
   - Works for large operations (higher limits)
   - Can be adjusted anytime

4. Predictable:
   - Riders know exactly what their limits are
   - No complex scenarios to remember
   - Clear feedback when limit reached

5. Easy to Communicate:
   - "You can handle 3 orders at once"
   - "Each order can have up to 2 pickups"
   - Simple rules

EXAMPLE CONFIGURATIONS:

Conservative Setup (Small operation):
- Max Active Orders: 1
- Max Merchants: 1
Result: One order, one merchant at a time. Simple and controlled.

Standard Setup (Medium operation):
- Max Active Orders: 2
- Max Merchants: 3
Result: Riders can handle 2 orders, each with up to 3 pickup locations.

Aggressive Setup (Large operation):
- Max Active Orders: 5
- Max Merchants: 5
Result: Experienced riders can handle complex multi-order scenarios.

Open Setup (Flexible operation):
- Max Active Orders: Unlimited
- Max Merchants: Unlimited
Result: Riders manage their own capacity, full freedom.

IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:

Phase 1: Add settings in admin dashboard
Phase 2: Implement validation when accepting orders
Phase 3: Show clear messaging to riders
Phase 4: Add visual indicators in pending orders
Phase 5: Track metrics (how often limits are hit)

This capacity-based system is more intuitive, flexible, and easier to manage than toggle combinations.
