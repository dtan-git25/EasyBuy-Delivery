Fix Rider Active Order card showing inflated merchant subtotals:

PROBLEM CONFIRMED:

Order ID: GROUP-7351f024-43a0-4fa0-927e-86a27f90af27

CURRENT (WRONG):
- Jollibee Subtotal: ₱250.50 ✗
- Mcdo Subtotal: ₱84.75 ✗
- Items Total: ₱60.50 ✗

EXPECTED (CORRECT):
- Jollibee Subtotal: ₱55.00 ✓ (Burger ₱45 + Drinks ₱10)
- Mcdo Subtotal: ₱65.00 ✓ (French Fries)
- Items Total: ₱120.00 ✓ (₱55 + ₱65)

ISSUE:

The merchant subtotals are being MASSIVELY INFLATED - similar to the issue we fixed in Customer My Orders. Fees or other amounts are being added to merchant subtotals when they should only show item costs.

ROOT CAUSE:

This is the SAME bug we fixed for Customer view - merchant subtotals are including fees or being calculated incorrectly for Rider view.

REQUIRED FIX:

1. MERCHANT SUBTOTALS = ITEMS ONLY:
   
   Jollibee:
   - Burger × 1 (with options): ₱45.00
   - Drinks × 1: ₱10.00
   - Jollibee Subtotal: ₱55.00 (items only, no fees)
   
   Mcdo:
   - French Fries × 1 (with options): ₱65.00
   - Mcdo Subtotal: ₱65.00 (items only, no fees)

2. ITEMS TOTAL = SUM OF MERCHANT SUBTOTALS:
   
   Items Total: ₱55.00 + ₱65.00 = ₱120.00

3. CHECK CALCULATION IN RIDER COMPONENT:
   
   In Rider Active Order card:
   - How are merchant subtotals calculated?
   - Are fees being added to merchant totals?
   - Use the SAME fix applied to Customer My Orders

4. COMPARE WITH CUSTOMER VIEW:
   
   Customer My Orders now shows correct subtotals.
   Apply the SAME calculation logic to Rider Active Orders.

5. VERIFY DATA SOURCE:
   
   Check if:
   - Wrong field being used for merchant subtotals
   - Fees being added during calculation
   - Total amount divided incorrectly

6. CORRECT BREAKDOWN FOR RIDER:
Jollibee                          ACCEPTED
Burger × 1                      ₱45.00
Toppings: Cheese              (₱5.00)
Size: Small                   (₱20.00)
Drinks × 1                      ₱10.00
Subtotal:                         ₱55.00 ← ITEMS ONLY
Mcdo                              ACCEPTED
French Fries × 1                ₱65.00
Size: Large                   (₱15.00)
Subtotal:                         ₱65.00 ← ITEMS ONLY
Order Breakdown:
Items Total:                      ₱120.00
Delivery Fee:                     ₱160.00
Multi-Merchant Fee:               ₱20.00
Rider's Convenience Fee:          ₱10.00
Total to Collect:                 ₱310.00
YOUR EARNINGS:                    ₱100.00

7. FIX PATTERN:
   
   Use the same logic that fixed Customer My Orders:
   - Merchant subtotal = sum of items for that merchant ONLY
   - No fees in merchant subtotals
   - Fees shown separately in Order Breakdown

The merchant subtotals are being inflated by including fees or wrong calculations. Apply the same fix used for Customer view to Rider view.

This is critical for rider to know correct amounts and for proper earnings calculation.
