Multi-Merchant Fee and Rider's Convenience Fee still not showing in Customer My Order card after implementation attempt:

PROBLEM:

After trying to add the fee lines, they still don't appear in Customer > My Orders card.

DEBUGGING NEEDED:

1. CHECK ORDER DATA:
   
   First verify the data exists in the order record:
   
   Log the order object in My Orders component:
```javascript
   console.log('Order data:', order);
   console.log('Multi-merchant fee:', order.multi_merchant_fee);
   console.log('Convenience fee:', order.convenience_fee || order.rider_commission);
```
   
   Check if these fields exist and have values.

2. CHECK DATABASE FIELDS:
   
   Verify the orders table has these columns:
   - multi_merchant_fee
   - convenience_fee (or rider_commission)
   
   Are these fields populated when order is created?

3. CHECK COMPONENT CODE:
   
   Find the Customer My Orders card component:
   - Locate where fees are displayed
   - Check if Multi-Merchant Fee and Convenience Fee lines were added
   - Verify the code is actually rendering these lines

4. COMMON ISSUES:
   
   A. Data not fetched:
   - Query doesn't include these fields
   - Fields exist but not selected in query
   
   B. Conditional hiding:
   - Code has condition that hides these lines
   - Check for: if (showFees) or similar
   
   C. Field name mismatch:
   - Code looks for "convenienceFee" but database has "rider_commission"
   - Code looks for "multiMerchantFee" but database has "multi_merchant_fee"
   
   D. Wrong component edited:
   - Multiple order display components
   - Edited one, but different one is being used

5. VERIFY LOCATION:
   
   The My Orders card is different from:
   - Order details page
   - Order tracking page
   - Checkout modal
   
   Make sure editing the correct component that shows in My Orders list.

6. STEP-BY-STEP FIX:
   
   Step 1: Check if data exists
```javascript
   console.log('Full order:', JSON.stringify(order, null, 2));
```
   
   Step 2: If data exists, verify display code
   - Look for where "Delivery Fee" is displayed
   - Add lines right after it for the other fees
   
   Step 3: If data doesn't exist
   - Update order query to include these fields
   - Ensure they're saved when order is created

7. EXPECTED STRUCTURE:
   
   In the component, should have something like:
```javascript
   <div>Items Subtotal: {itemsTotal}</div>
   <div>Delivery Fee: {deliveryFee}</div>
   <div>Multi-Merchant Fee: {multiMerchantFee}</div>  ← Add
   <div>Convenience Fee: {convenienceFee}</div>  ← Add
   <div>Grand Total: {grandTotal}</div>
```

8. TEST WITH CONSOLE:
   
   Add visible test text to verify component is being edited:
```javascript
   <div>TEST: FEES SECTION</div>
   <div>Multi-Merchant Fee: ₱20.00</div>
   <div>Convenience Fee: ₱20.00</div>
```
   
   If "TEST" doesn't appear, you're editing wrong component.

Without seeing the actual component code or data structure, add extensive logging to identify:
- Is the data available?
- Is the component being rendered?
- Why aren't the lines showing?

Share the console logs showing the order data structure so we can see if the fees are present.
