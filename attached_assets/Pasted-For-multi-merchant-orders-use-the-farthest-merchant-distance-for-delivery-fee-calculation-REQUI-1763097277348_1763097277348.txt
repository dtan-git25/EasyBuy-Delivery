For multi-merchant orders, use the farthest merchant distance for delivery fee calculation:

REQUIREMENT:

When customer orders from multiple merchants, calculate delivery fee based on the FARTHEST merchant's distance from customer, not the sum of all distances.

CURRENT (WRONG):
- Store 1 (2 km): ₱70 delivery fee
- Store 2 (1 km): ₱60 delivery fee
- Total: ₱130 (sum of both)

REQUIRED (CORRECT):
- Store 1 (2 km): ₱70 delivery fee
- Store 2 (1 km): ₱60 delivery fee
- Order uses: ₱70 (farthest merchant only)

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. CALCULATE DISTANCE TO EACH MERCHANT:
   - Get customer delivery address coordinates
   - For each merchant in the order, get store coordinates
   - Calculate distance from customer to each merchant
   - Store 1: 2 km
   - Store 2: 1 km
   - Store 3: 1.5 km

2. FIND FARTHEST MERCHANT:
   - Identify which merchant is farthest from customer
   - Use maximum distance among all merchants
   - Example: max(2 km, 1 km, 1.5 km) = 2 km

3. CALCULATE DELIVERY FEE:
   - Use admin's delivery fee settings (base rate + succeeding rate)
   - Calculate fee based on farthest distance only
   - Example: 2 km → ₱70 delivery fee

4. APPLY TO ORDER:
   - Use single delivery fee for entire order
   - Not sum of individual merchant fees
   - Not average distance

5. DISPLAY IN CHECKOUT:

   Multi-Merchant Order:
   Items Subtotal: ₱500.00
   Delivery Fee (2 km): ₱70.00  ← Based on farthest merchant
   Multi-Merchant Fee: ₱20.00
   Rider's Commission: ₱20.00
   TOTAL: ₱610.00

6. SHOW BREAKDOWN (OPTIONAL):
   Could show which merchant is farthest:
   "Delivery Fee (2 km - farthest location): ₱70.00"

7. LOGIC:
   - Single merchant order: Use that merchant's distance
   - Multi-merchant order: Use farthest merchant's distance
   - Makes sense because rider must travel to farthest point

REASONING:
Rider will travel to the farthest merchant location anyway, so delivery fee should be based on that maximum distance, not the sum of all merchant distances.

Example calculation:
- Customer at point A
- Store 1 at 2 km from customer
- Store 2 at 1 km from customer
- Rider travels max 2 km to reach farthest store
- Delivery fee based on 2 km, not 3 km total

Fix the delivery fee calculation for multi-merchant orders to use farthest merchant distance only.
