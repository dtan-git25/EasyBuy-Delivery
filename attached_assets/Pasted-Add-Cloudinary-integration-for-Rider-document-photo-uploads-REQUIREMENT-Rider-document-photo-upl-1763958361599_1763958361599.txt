Add Cloudinary integration for Rider document photo uploads:

REQUIREMENT:

Rider document photo uploads in Rider registration/profile (Documents tab) are still using local /uploads storage. Need to migrate to Cloudinary like other image uploads.

CURRENT SITUATION:
✅ Admin logo upload: Uses Cloudinary
✅ Merchant store photos: Uses Cloudinary
✅ Menu item photos: Uses Cloudinary
❌ Rider document photos: Still using local /uploads (NEEDS FIX)

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. FIND RIDER DOCUMENT UPLOAD ENDPOINTS:
   
   Locate endpoints that handle rider document uploads:
   - Likely: POST /api/riders/upload-documents
   - Or: POST /api/riders/{id}/documents
   - Or similar rider document upload routes
   
   These might handle:
   - Government ID photo
   - Driver's license
   - Vehicle registration
   - Any other verification documents

2. UPDATE TO USE CLOUDINARY:
   
   Replace local file storage with Cloudinary upload:
```javascript
   // Current (local storage - WRONG):
   const storage = multer.diskStorage({
     destination: './uploads/riders/documents/',
     filename: (req, file, cb) => {...}
   });
   
   // Change to (Cloudinary - CORRECT):
   const result = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(req.file.path, {
     folder: `easybuydelivery-${env}/riders/${riderId}/documents`,
     resource_type: 'image',
     public_id: `${documentType}_${timestamp}`
   });
```

3. FOLDER STRUCTURE IN CLOUDINARY:
   
   Organize rider documents:
easybuydelivery-dev/
└── riders/
└── {rider_id}/
└── documents/
├── government_id
├── drivers_license
├── vehicle_registration
└── other_docs
   
   Or simpler:
easybuydelivery-dev/riders/{rider_id}/
├── government_id
├── drivers_license
└── vehicle_registration

4. USE SAME PATTERN AS WORKING UPLOADS:
   
   Copy the successful implementation from merchant photo upload:
   - Same multer configuration
   - Same Cloudinary upload pattern
   - Same error handling
   - Just change folder path to riders

5. UPDATE DATABASE:
   
   Ensure rider document URLs are stored correctly:
   - government_id_url: Cloudinary URL
   - drivers_license_url: Cloudinary URL
   - vehicle_registration_url: Cloudinary URL
   - Any other document URL fields

6. HANDLE MULTIPLE DOCUMENTS:
   
   If rider can upload multiple documents:
```javascript
   // Multiple file upload
   upload.fields([
     { name: 'government_id', maxCount: 1 },
     { name: 'drivers_license', maxCount: 1 },
     { name: 'vehicle_registration', maxCount: 1 }
   ])
   
   // Upload each to Cloudinary
   for (const [fieldName, files] of Object.entries(req.files)) {
     const file = files[0];
     const result = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(file.path, {
       folder: `easybuydelivery-${env}/riders/${riderId}/documents`,
       public_id: fieldName
     });
     // Save result.secure_url to database
   }
```

7. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
   
   For sensitive rider documents:
   - Use private Cloudinary URLs if needed
   - Add access control
   - Consider adding authenticated URLs with expiration
   - Ensure only admin/owner can view rider documents

8. UPDATE FRONTEND:
   
   Change document image display:
   - From: /uploads/riders/documents/id.jpg
   - To: Cloudinary URL from database

9. DOCUMENT TYPES TO HANDLE:
   
   Common rider documents:
   - Government-issued ID
   - Driver's license
   - Vehicle registration
   - Insurance documents
   - Profile photo (if separate from ID)
   - Background check documents
   - Any other verification photos

10. TESTING:
    
    After implementation:
    - Upload rider documents during registration
    - Verify images upload to Cloudinary
    - Check correct folder structure
    - Verify URLs saved to database
    - Test document display in admin/rider views
    - Test updating/replacing documents

Apply the same Cloudinary integration that works for merchant photos and menu items to rider document uploads. Use consistent patterns and folder organization.
