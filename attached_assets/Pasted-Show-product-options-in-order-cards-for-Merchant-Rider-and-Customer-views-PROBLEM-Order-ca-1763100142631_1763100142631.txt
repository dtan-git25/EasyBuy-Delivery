Show product options in order cards for Merchant, Rider, and Customer views:

PROBLEM:

Order cards are only showing base item names, not the selected options (Size, Flavor, Add-ons, etc.)

MISSING IN:
- Merchant Active Orders card
- Rider Active Orders card
- Customer My Orders card (all statuses: pending, active, completed, cancelled)

OPTIONS ARE SHOWING IN:
- Customer Add to Cart modal ✓
- Customer All Restaurant Carts modal ✓
- Customer Checkout modal ✓

REQUIRED FIX:

Display the complete order item breakdown with options in all order cards, using the same format as cart/checkout.

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. INCLUDE OPTIONS IN ORDER DATA:
   When order is placed, save product options with order items:
   - Base price
   - Each selected option (type, value, price)
   - Total item price

2. FETCH OPTIONS WITH ORDERS:
   When loading orders for any view, include options data:
   - Query should fetch order items with their options
   - Include option type name, value name, and price

3. DISPLAY FORMAT:
   Use same structure as cart/checkout:
   - Item name and quantity with total
   - Indented options below
   - Each option shows type, value, and price
   - Clear visual hierarchy

4. APPLY TO ALL ORDER VIEWS:
   
   Merchant:
   - Active orders
   - Order history
   - Order details
   
   Rider:
   - Pending orders
   - Active orders
   - Completed orders
   - Order details
   
   Customer:
   - My Orders (all statuses)
   - Order tracking
   - Order history
   - Order details

5. CONSISTENT STYLING:
   - Item: Bold, normal size
   - Options: Indented, smaller font, gray
   - Prices: Right-aligned
   - Same as cart/checkout display

6. HANDLE MULTI-MERCHANT:
   For multi-merchant orders, group by merchant:
   
   Merchant 1: Jollibee
   - Burger × 1 (with options)
   
   Merchant 2: McDonald's
   - Big Mac × 1 (with options)

This ensures everyone (merchant, rider, customer) can see exactly what was ordered with all customizations, just like it appeared in the cart/checkout.
