Fix All Restaurant Carts modal - remove incorrect Restaurant Markup calculation:

PROBLEM:

Add to Cart Modal shows (CORRECT):
- Base Price × 1: ₱22.00
- Cheese × 1: ₱5.50
- Large × 1: ₱27.50
- Total: ₱55.00

All Restaurant Carts Modal shows (INCORRECT):
- 1x Burger ₱80.00
- Base Price: ₱50.00
- Toppings: Cheese (₱5.00)
- Size: Large (₱25.00)
- Subtotal: ₱80.00
- Restaurant Markup (10%): ₱8.00  ← WRONG - Remove this
- Total: ₱88.00

ISSUES:

1. MARKUP ALREADY APPLIED TO ITEM PRICES:
   - Base price shown to customer already includes markup
   - When customer sees ₱22.00, markup is already included
   - Don't calculate markup again at cart level

2. DOUBLE MARKUP:
   - Applying markup twice: once on item display, again on cart total
   - This is incorrect and overcharges customer

3. PRICE DISCREPANCY:
   - Prices in add to cart: ₱22, ₱5.50, ₱27.50
   - Prices in cart: ₱50, ₱5, ₱25
   - These don't match - which is correct?

REQUIRED FIX:

1. REMOVE MARKUP LINE FROM CART:
   - Delete "Restaurant Markup (10%): ₱8.00" line completely
   - Do NOT calculate markup on subtotal in cart
   - Markup is already included in displayed item prices

2. SHOW CORRECT PRICES:
   - Use the same prices shown in add to cart modal
   - Base Price: ₱22.00 (not ₱50.00)
   - Cheese: ₱5.50 (not ₱5.00)
   - Large: ₱27.50 (not ₱25.00)
   - Total: ₱55.00 (not ₱88.00)

3. CART SHOULD DISPLAY:

   1x Burger                    ₱55.00
     Base Price: ₱22.00
     Size: Large (₱27.50)
     Toppings: Cheese (₱5.50)
   
   Subtotal: ₱55.00

   NO markup line
   NO additional calculation

MARKUP LOGIC CLARIFICATION:

Markup is applied when prices are displayed to customer:
- Merchant's base price: ₱20 (hidden from customer)
- 10% markup: ₱2
- Customer sees: ₱22 ← This already includes markup

In cart:
- Just use the marked-up prices already shown
- Don't calculate markup again
- Don't show markup as separate line

Markup is invisible to customer - they just see final prices.

Fix the cart modal to show correct prices from add to cart and remove the duplicate markup calculation.
