   - Order details/tracking page
   - Active orders
   - Order history
   - Completed orders
   - Cancelled orders

2. MERCHANT VIEWS:
   - New orders (pending)
   - Active orders (accepted, preparing, ready)

3. RIDER VIEWS:

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Ensure landmark is saved to database:

   - Field: landmark (text)

2. Include landmark in all order queries:
   - When fetching orders for any view
   - SELECT landmark along with address fields

3. Display landmark consistently:
   - Always show after address
   - Use landmark icon: 📍 or landmark emoji
   - Label clearly: "Landmark:" or "Near:"
   - Don't hide it even if empty (show "No landmark provided")

4. Make it prominent for riders:
   - Bold or highlighted in active orders
   - Easy to read and find
   - Helps riders locate delivery address

5. Include in all order status displays:
   - Pending → Show landmark
   - Accepted → Show landmark
   - Picked Up → Show landmark
   - In Transit → Show landmark
   - Delivered → Show landmark (for records)
