Add Admin List management to Owner account in User Management tab:

REQUIREMENT:

In Owner account dashboard, add Admin Management section to User Management tab, Create Administrative Account card showing list of all admin accounts with ability to view information and delete.

Use the same UI/code pattern as existing Customer Management and Rider Management sections.

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. ADMIN LIST DISPLAY:
   
   Show table/list with columns:
   - Admin Name
   - Email
   - Phone Number
   - Account Created Date
   - Status (Active/Inactive)
   - Actions (View, Delete)

2. VIEW ADMIN DETAILS:
   
   When clicking View, show modal/page with:
   - Full Name
   - Email
   - Phone Number
   - Role: Admin
   - Account Created Date
   - Last Login
   - Status
   - Close button

3. DELETE ADMIN:
   
   When clicking Delete:
   - Show confirmation dialog: "Are you sure you want to delete this admin account?"
   - If confirmed, delete admin from database
   - Show success message
   - Refresh admin list
   - Owner account CANNOT be deleted (disable delete button for owner)

4. PERMISSIONS:
   
   Only accessible by:
   - Owner account (david.jthan@gmail.com)
   - NOT accessible by regular admins
   - Owner is the only one who can manage other admins

5. REUSE EXISTING CODE:
   
   Copy the structure from:
   - Customer Management component/page
   - Or Rider Management component/page
   - Adapt for admin accounts
   - Same table layout, same modal, same delete confirmation

6. QUERY ADMINS:
   
   Fetch all admin accounts:
   - Get all users where role = 'admin' or 'owner'
   - Exclude current logged-in owner from list (or show but disable delete)
   - Order by created date descending

7. SAFETY:
   
   Protection mechanisms:
   - Owner account cannot be deleted
   - Show warning if trying to delete last admin
   - Require confirmation before deletion
   - Log admin deletions for audit trail

8. UI CONSISTENCY:
   
   Match the design of Customer/Rider Management:
   - Same table style
   - Same action buttons
   - Same modal/detail view
   - Same confirmation dialogs

This gives the owner full visibility and control over admin accounts using the familiar interface pattern already established in the system.
