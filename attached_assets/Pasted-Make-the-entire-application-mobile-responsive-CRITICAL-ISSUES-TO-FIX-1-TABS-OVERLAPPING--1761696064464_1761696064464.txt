Make the entire application mobile responsive:

CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX:

1. TABS OVERLAPPING:
   - Navigation tabs are overlapping each other on mobile screens
   - Fix tab layout to stack vertically or scroll horizontally on mobile
   - Reduce tab padding/font size on mobile
   - Use responsive breakpoints (768px for tablets, 480px for mobile)

2. CHATBOX TOO BIG ON MOBILE:
   - Chat modal takes up too much screen space on mobile
   - Make chatbox responsive:
     * Full height on mobile (bottom sheet style)
     * Reduce padding and margins
     * Smaller font sizes
     * Compact message bubbles
     * Smaller input field
     * Header should be fixed at top

   - md: (768px)
   - lg: (1024px)
   - xl: (1280px)

   Example:
   - className="w-full md:w-1/2 lg:w-1/3"
   - className="text-sm md:text-base"
   - className="p-2 md:p-4"

Make every page and component work perfectly on mobile devices with proper touch targets, readable text, and no overlapping elements.
