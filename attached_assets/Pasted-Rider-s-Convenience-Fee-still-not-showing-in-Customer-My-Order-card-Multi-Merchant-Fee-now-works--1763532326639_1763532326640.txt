Rider's Convenience Fee still not showing in Customer My Order card (Multi-Merchant Fee now works):

PROBLEM:

Multi-Merchant Fee is now displaying correctly ✓
But Rider's Convenience Fee is still missing ✗

DEBUGGING:

1. CHECK ORDER DATA:
   
   Log the order object to see if convenience fee exists:
```javascript
   console.log('Order data:', order);
   console.log('Rider convenience fee:', order.rider_convenience_fee);
   console.log('Or convenience_fee:', order.convenience_fee);
   console.log('Or rider_commission:', order.rider_commission);
```
   
   The field might be named differently.

2. CHECK FIELD NAME:
   
   The database might use different naming:
   - rider_convenience_fee
   - convenience_fee
   - rider_commission
   - riders_commission
   
   Multi-Merchant Fee works, so check what field name is used for it, and use similar pattern.

3. CHECK IF FIELD EXISTS:
   
   Verify the convenience fee is:
   - Saved to database when order is created
   - Included in the order query
   - Present in the order object

4. COMPARE WITH MULTI-MERCHANT FEE:
   
   Since Multi-Merchant Fee now works:
   - What field name does it use?
   - How is it displayed in the code?
   - Copy the same pattern for Convenience Fee

5. LIKELY ISSUES:
   
   A. Field name mismatch:
   - Code looks for "convenienceFee"
   - Database has "rider_commission"
   - Or vice versa
   
   B. Not included in query:
   - Multi-merchant fee was added to query
   - But convenience fee wasn't added
   
   C. Null/zero value:
   - Field exists but value is null or 0
   - Conditional display hides it

6. FIX PATTERN:
   
   If Multi-Merchant Fee code looks like:
```javascript
   {order.multi_merchant_fee && (
     <div>Multi-Merchant Fee: ₱{order.multi_merchant_fee}</div>
   )}
```
   
   Add similar line for Convenience Fee:
```javascript
   {order.rider_convenience_fee && (
     <div>Rider's Convenience Fee: ₱{order.rider_convenience_fee}</div>
   )}
```
   
   Or use whatever field name actually exists in database.

7. CHECK QUERY:
   
   Where orders are fetched for My Orders:
   - Ensure query selects convenience_fee (or whatever the field is named)
   - If Multi-Merchant Fee was added to SELECT, add Convenience Fee too

8. VERIFY DATABASE VALUE:
   
   Check the actual order record in database:
   - Does it have a convenience fee value?
   - Is it ₱20.00 as expected?
   - What is the exact column name?

Add a console.log to see all available fields in the order object, then use the correct field name to display the Rider's Convenience Fee.

The pattern that worked for Multi-Merchant Fee should work for Convenience Fee too - just need to use the correct field name.
