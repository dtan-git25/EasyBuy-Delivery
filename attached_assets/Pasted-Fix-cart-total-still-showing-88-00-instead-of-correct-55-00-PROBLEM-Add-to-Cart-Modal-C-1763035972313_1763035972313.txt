Fix cart total - still showing ₱88.00 instead of correct ₱55.00:

PROBLEM:

Add to Cart Modal (CORRECT):
- Base Price: ₱22.00
- Cheese: ₱5.50
- Large: ₱27.50
- Total: ₱55.00 ✓

All Restaurant Carts Modal (WRONG):
- 1x Burger ₱88.00 ✗
- Toppings: Cheese (no price shown)
- Size: Large (no price shown)
- Subtotal: ₱88.00 ✗
- Total: ₱88.00 ✗

ISSUES:

1. WRONG TOTAL:
   - Should be ₱55.00
   - Showing ₱88.00
   - Where is ₱88.00 coming from?

2. OPTION PRICES NOT SHOWING:
   - Options displayed but no prices
   - Should show: Cheese (₱5.50), Large (₱27.50)

3. CALCULATION ERROR:
   - Cart is calculating wrong total
   - Not using correct prices from add to cart

DEBUGGING NEEDED:

1. CHECK CART DATA:
   - Log cart item data: console.log('Cart item:', cartItem)
   - Check what prices are stored
   - Verify base price and option prices

2. CHECK CALCULATION:
   - How is ₱88.00 being calculated?
   - Is it doubling ₱55 somehow? (55 × 1.6 = 88)
   - Is merchant markup being applied again?
   - Is it using wrong base price?

3. CHECK DATA SOURCE:
   - When item added to cart, what prices are saved?
   - Are marked-up prices saved? Or base prices?
   - Are option prices correct in cart data?

REQUIRED FIX:

1. USE CORRECT PRICES:
   - Cart should use exact same prices as add to cart modal
   - Base: ₱22.00
   - Cheese: ₱5.50
   - Large: ₱27.50
   - Total: ₱22.00 + ₱5.50 + ₱27.50 = ₱55.00

2. SHOW OPTION PRICES:
   - Display price next to each option
   - Toppings: Cheese (₱5.50)
   - Size: Large (₱27.50)

3. CORRECT CALCULATION:
   - Total = Base Price + Sum of all option prices
   - Don't apply any additional markup
   - Don't multiply or modify prices

4. DEBUG LOG:
   Add logging to see actual values:
   - Log base price
   - Log each option price
   - Log calculation steps
   - Find where ₱88.00 comes from

The cart is using wrong calculation or wrong data. Need to identify where ₱88.00 is coming from and fix to use correct ₱55.00 total.
