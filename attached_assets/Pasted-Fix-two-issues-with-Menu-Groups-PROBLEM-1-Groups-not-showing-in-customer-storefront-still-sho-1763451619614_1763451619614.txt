Fix two issues with Menu Groups:

PROBLEM 1: Groups not showing in customer storefront - still showing categories

Customer storefront should display items grouped by merchant's custom Menu Groups, but it's still displaying by categories.

FIX REQUIRED:

1. UPDATE CUSTOMER STOREFRONT QUERY:
   When customer views a merchant's menu, fetch menu items grouped by menu_groups instead of categories.

   Query should:
   - Fetch all menu groups for this merchant (ordered by display_order)
   - For each group, fetch items in that group (ordered by display_order within group)
   - Also fetch ungrouped items (items not in any group)

2. CUSTOMER STOREFRONT DISPLAY:

   Replace category grouping with menu group grouping:

   FROM (current - wrong):
   Burgers ▼
     • Cheeseburger - ₱155
   Drinks ▼
     • Iced Tea - ₱30

   TO (required - correct):
   Best Sellers ▼
     • Cheeseburger - ₱155
     • Fries - ₱80
   Breakfast Menu ▼
     • Pancakes - ₱120
   Other Items ▼
     • (ungrouped items)

3. CHECK FRONTEND COMPONENT:
   - Find customer merchant view component
   - Update to use groups instead of categories for display
   - Fetch groups from API
   - Render items under their groups

4. API ENDPOINT:
   Ensure there's an endpoint that returns:
```json
   {
     "groups": [
       {
         "id": 1,
         "name": "Best Sellers",
         "display_order": 1,
         "items": [...]
       },
       {
         "id": 2,
         "name": "Breakfast Menu",
         "display_order": 2,
         "items": [...]
       }
     ],
     "ungrouped_items": [...]
   }
```

PROBLEM 2: Menu groups cannot be rearranged - not draggable

In Merchant Menu Management, groups should be draggable to reorder but drag functionality is not working.

FIX REQUIRED:

1. ADD DRAG AND DROP:
   Implement drag and drop for menu groups list:
   - Each group row should have drag handle (☰ icon)
   - Drag to reorder groups
   - Save new order to database

2. IMPLEMENTATION:
   Use drag and drop library or native HTML5 drag:
   - Add draggable="true" to group rows
   - Add drag handles
   - Implement onDragStart, onDragOver, onDrop handlers
   - Update display_order in database on drop

3. SIMILAR TO OPTION TYPE REORDERING:
   Use the same drag and drop pattern used for reordering product options (which is already working).

4. SAVE ORDER:
   When user drags and drops:
   - Update display_order values
   - Save to database: UPDATE menu_groups SET display_order = ? WHERE id = ?
   - Re-fetch or update UI to show new order

5. VISUAL FEEDBACK:
   - Drag handle icon visible on hover
   - Visual indication during drag
   - Drop zone highlighting
   - Cursor changes to grab/grabbing

6. ALSO FOR ITEMS WITHIN GROUP:
   Items within each group should also be draggable to reorder within that group.

Both issues need fixing:
1. Customer sees groups instead of categories
2. Merchant can drag to reorder groups

Implement drag and drop functionality for menu groups and ensure customer storefront fetches and displays by groups.
