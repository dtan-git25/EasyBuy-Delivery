Fix order price calculation mismatch for multi-merchant orders:

PROBLEM:

When customer places multi-merchant order, the prices in checkout are correct, but after order is placed, individual merchant subtotals are WRONG (inflated) while total remains correct.

CHECKOUT (CORRECT):
- Mcdo subtotal: ₱74.75 ✓
- Jollibee subtotal: ₱60.50 ✓
- Items Subtotal: ₱135.25 ✓
- Delivery Fee: ₱160.00
- Multi-Merchant Fee: ₱20.00
- Rider's Convenience Fee: ₱20.00
- Total: ₱335.25 ✓

AFTER ORDER PLACED (WRONG):
- Mcdo subtotal: ₱84.75 ✗ (should be ₱74.75)
- Jollibee subtotal: ₱250.50 ✗ (should be ₱60.50)
- But Total: ₱335.25 ✓ (correct)

ISSUE:

When saving the order to database, the merchant subtotals are being calculated incorrectly. The individual store subtotals are being inflated, possibly by:
- Adding fees to merchant subtotals
- Incorrect grouping calculation
- Adding delivery/multi-merchant fee to wrong place

DEBUGGING:

1. CHECK ORDER CREATION CODE:
   
   When multi-merchant order is placed, verify:
   - How are merchant subtotals calculated?
   - Are fees being added to merchant totals?
   - Should be: items only, no fees

2. VERIFY SAVED DATA:
   
   Check database after order placed:
   - What subtotal is saved for Mcdo merchant?
   - What subtotal is saved for Jollibee merchant?
   - Are they inflated in database or only in display?

3. LIKELY CAUSES:

   A. Fees added to merchant subtotal:
   - Multi-merchant fee added to merchant total
   - Delivery fee portion added to merchant
   - Should be: Merchant subtotal = items ONLY

   B. Calculation during save:
   - Correct in checkout
   - Wrong calculation when creating order records
   - Check order creation mutation

   C. Display issue:
   - Saved correctly in database
   - Wrong calculation when displaying
   - Check order display component

4. CORRECT CALCULATION:

   For multi-merchant order:
   
   Mcdo:
   - French Fries × 1: ₱74.75
   - Mcdo Subtotal: ₱74.75 (items only)
   
   Jollibee:
   - Burger × 1: ₱49.50
   - Drinks × 1: ₱11.00
   - Jollibee Subtotal: ₱60.50 (items only)
   
   Order level:
   - Items Subtotal: ₱135.25 (sum of merchants)
   - Delivery Fee: ₱160.00
   - Multi-Merchant Fee: ₱20.00
   - Rider's Convenience Fee: ₱20.00
   - Total: ₱335.25

   Merchant subtotals should NEVER include fees!

5. FIX THE CALCULATION:

   In order creation code:
   - Calculate merchant subtotal = sum of items only
   - Don't add any fees to merchant subtotal
   - Fees are order-level, not merchant-level
   - Each merchant gets their items total only

6. CHECK SPLIT ORDER LOGIC:

   For multi-merchant:
   - Create separate order record per merchant?
   - Or single order with multiple merchants?
   - Ensure subtotals are correctly separated

7. VERIFY DISPLAY:

   In Customer My Orders:
   - Should show correct merchant subtotals
   - Pull from database correctly
   - Display items total for each merchant

The merchant subtotals are being inflated by ₱10 (Mcdo: 74.75→84.75) and much more for Jollibee (60.50→250.50). Find where fees or extra amounts are being added to merchant subtotals during order creation or display.

Fix the calculation so merchant subtotals remain as items-only totals, with fees calculated at order level.
