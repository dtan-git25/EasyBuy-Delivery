CRITICAL PRIVACY BUG - All customers sharing the same cart!

PROBLEM:
When Customer 1 adds items to cart (e.g., 3x Burger), ALL other customers also see those same items in their carts. Customers are sharing one cart instead of having individual carts.

This is a SEVERE privacy and data isolation issue.

ROOT CAUSE:
Cart data is not being filtered by customer_id. All customers are seeing and sharing the same cart.

IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED:

1. CART STORAGE:
   When saving cart items, ALWAYS include and check customer_id:
   - Each cart item must be linked to specific customer
   - Save customer_id with every cart item
   - Cannot save cart without customer_id

2. CART FETCHING:
   When displaying cart, ALWAYS filter by logged-in customer:
   - Query: WHERE customer_id = current_logged_in_customer_id
   - NEVER fetch all cart items from database
   - Only show items belonging to that specific customer

3. CART OPERATIONS:
   Every cart action must check customer_id:
   - Add to cart: Save with customer_id
   - Update quantity: Check customer_id
   - Remove item: Check customer_id
   - Clear cart: Only clear current customer's items

4. SESSION/CONTEXT:
   Ensure cart operations use correct customer context:
   - Get customer_id from authenticated session
   - Never use default or shared cart
   - Each customer has isolated cart

5. DATABASE VERIFICATION:
   Check cart_items table:
   - Does it have customer_id column?
   - Are cart items saved with correct customer_id?
   - Or are all items saved with null/same customer_id?

6. SIMILAR TO ADDRESS BUG:
   This is the SAME issue as customers sharing addresses:
   - Lack of proper data isolation
   - Not filtering by customer_id
   - All customers seeing everyone's data

7. CHECK ALL USER DATA:
   Verify proper isolation for:
   - Cart items ← Current issue
   - Saved addresses ← Previous issue  
   - Orders (customer should only see their orders)
   - Notifications ← Previous issue
   - Payment history
   - Any customer-specific data

8. TEST AFTER FIX:
   - Customer A adds 3x Burger
   - Customer B logs in
   - Customer B should see EMPTY cart
   - Customer B adds 2x Pizza
   - Customer A should still see only 3x Burger
   - Customer B should see only 2x Pizza

CRITICAL PRIORITY:
This is a data privacy violation. Customers can see and potentially order using other customers' cart items. This MUST be fixed immediately before any production use.

All customer data must be properly filtered by customer_id throughout the entire application.
