Implement rider booking restrictions with admin controls:

ADMIN SETTINGS (Settings tab > Multi-Merchant Checkout section):

Add two toggle settings:

1. DOUBLE ORDER BOOKING (Toggle ON/OFF)
   - Setting name: "Allow Double Order Booking"
   - Default: OFF
   
   When ENABLED:
   - Rider can accept up to 2 orders from different customers simultaneously
   - Once 2 orders are accepted, rider is "locked" from accepting more
   - Both orders must be marked as delivered or cancelled before rider can accept new orders
   - Pending orders list shows message: "Complete your 2 active orders before accepting more"
   
   When DISABLED:
   - Rider can only accept 1 order at a time from any customer
   - Must complete current order before accepting another

2. MULTIPLE MERCHANT BOOKING (Toggle ON/OFF)
   - Setting name: "Allow Multiple Merchant Orders (Same Customer)"
   - Default: OFF
   
   When ENABLED:
   - Rider can accept one customer's order even if it contains multiple merchants
   - Example: Customer orders from 3 restaurants, rider accepts all pickups in 1 order
   - Limited to 1 accepted multi-merchant order at a time
   - Must complete this order before accepting new orders
   
   When DISABLED:
   - Rider cannot accept orders with multiple merchants
   - Or restrict to accepting only single-merchant orders

RIDER EXPERIENCE:

In Pending Orders:
- Check rider's current active order count
- Check booking restriction settings from admin
- If restrictions met, disable Accept buttons on pending orders
- Show message explaining why they can't accept

Scenarios based on settings:

Scenario A - Both OFF:
- Rider accepts 1 order maximum
- Must deliver/cancel before accepting another

Scenario B - Double booking ON, Multiple merchant OFF:
- Rider can accept 2 separate customer orders (single merchant each)
- Cannot accept orders with multiple merchants
- Must complete both before accepting more

Scenario C - Double booking OFF, Multiple merchant ON:
- Rider can accept 1 order with multiple merchants from same customer
- Cannot accept second order until first is complete

Scenario D - Both ON:
- Rider can accept 2 orders from different customers
- Each order can have multiple merchants
- Maximum 2 orders active at once

VALIDATION LOGIC:

Before allowing order acceptance:
1. Count rider's active orders (status: accepted, picked_up, in_transit)
2. Check admin double booking setting
3. Check if order has multiple merchants
4. Check admin multiple merchant setting
5. Apply restrictions accordingly
6. Show appropriate error message if restricted

ERROR MESSAGES:

"You have reached the maximum of 2 active orders. Please complete your current deliveries first."

"Multiple merchant orders are currently disabled. Complete your active order first."

"You already have an active multi-merchant order. Complete it before accepting another."

DATABASE:

Save settings in admin_settings table:
- allow_double_booking (boolean, default: false)
- allow_multiple_merchant_booking (boolean, default: false)

Track in orders:
- merchant_count (number of merchants in order)
- order_group_id (if multiple merchants from same customer)

This gives admin control over rider workload and delivery efficiency while preventing riders from being overwhelmed with too many simultaneous orders.
