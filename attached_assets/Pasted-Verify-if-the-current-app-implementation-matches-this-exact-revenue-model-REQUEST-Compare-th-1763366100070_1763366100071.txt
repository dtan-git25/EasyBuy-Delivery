Verify if the current app implementation matches this exact revenue model:

REQUEST:

Compare the app's current earning calculation and distribution system with the model below. Confirm if they match exactly or identify any discrepancies.

EXPECTED REVENUE MODEL:

SINGLE MERCHANT ORDER:
- Customer Pays: Items (₱500) + Delivery Fee (₱100) + Rider's Commission (₱15) = ₱615

Distribution:
- Merchant: ₱490 (Items ₱500 - Markup ₱10)
- App: ₱60 (50% of DF: ₱50 + Markup: ₱10)
- Rider: ₱65 (Commission: ₱15 + 50% of DF: ₱50)

Formulas:
- App Earnings = [(DF + Multi-Merchant Fee) × App %] + Order Markup
- Rider Earnings = Rider's Commission + [(DF + Multi-Merchant Fee) × (100% - App %)]
- Merchant Earnings = Items Subtotal - Order Markup

MULTI-MERCHANT ORDER:
- Customer Pays: Items (₱500) + Delivery Fee (₱100) + Multi-Merchant Fee (₱20) + Rider's Commission (₱15) = ₱635

Distribution:
- Merchant: ₱490 (Items ₱500 - Markup ₱10)
- App: ₱70 (50% of DF+Multi: ₱60 + Markup: ₱10)
- Rider: ₱75 (Commission: ₱15 + 50% of DF+Multi: ₱60)

KEY POINTS TO VERIFY:

1. Does the app add Delivery Fee + Multi-Merchant Fee FIRST, then multiply by App Earnings %?
2. Is the remaining percentage (100% - App %) going to Rider?
3. Is Rider's Commission a separate fixed amount added to rider earnings?
4. Does merchant receive base cost (items subtotal minus markup)?
5. Does app keep 100% of order markup?
6. Is Multi-Merchant Fee only applied when 2+ merchants in order?
7. Do all amounts balance: Customer Payment = Merchant + App + Rider earnings?

VERIFICATION NEEDED:

Check the actual code implementation:
- Order creation calculation
- Earnings distribution logic
- Database fields storing these values
- Display in checkout, order details, earnings logs

Confirm if current implementation matches this model EXACTLY or report any differences found.

If there are discrepancies, specify:
- What the current code does differently
- Which calculations are incorrect
- What needs to be fixed to match this model
