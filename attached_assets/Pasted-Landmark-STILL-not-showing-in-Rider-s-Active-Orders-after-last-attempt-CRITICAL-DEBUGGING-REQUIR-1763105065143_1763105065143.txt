Landmark STILL not showing in Rider's Active Orders after last attempt:

CRITICAL DEBUGGING REQUIRED:

Landmark is not displaying. We need to trace the complete data flow to find where it's breaking.

1. VERIFY LANDMARK EXISTS IN DATABASE:
   
   Check the orders table for this specific order:
   - Order ID: EBD-1763104278605
   - Query: SELECT delivery_landmark, delivery_address FROM orders WHERE id = ?
   - Is there a landmark field?
   - What value does it contain?
   - Share the actual database value

2. CHECK CUSTOMER'S ADDRESS:
   
   For the customer who placed this order:
   - Check their saved addresses in customer_addresses table
   - Does the address they used have a landmark?
   - What is the landmark value?
   - Example: "Near Gasoline Station"

3. CHECK ORDER CREATION:
   
   Add logging when order is placed:
   - console.log('Creating order with landmark:', landmark)
   - console.log('Selected address:', selectedAddress)
   - Is landmark being passed during order creation?
   - Is it being saved to orders table?

4. CHECK RIDER'S QUERY:
   
   Add logging in rider's active orders endpoint:
   - console.log('Fetched order for rider:', order)
   - Check if landmark field exists in response
   - What value does it have (null, empty string, or actual landmark)?

5. CHECK RIDER'S DISPLAY COMPONENT:
   
   Add logging in rider's active order card:
   - console.log('Displaying order:', order)
   - console.log('Landmark:', order.landmark)
   - Is the data reaching the component?
   - Is the display logic correct?

6. POSSIBLE ISSUES:

   Issue A: Landmark not being saved during order creation
   - Fix: Include landmark when inserting order

   Issue B: Landmark saved but not fetched in rider query
   - Fix: Add landmark to SELECT statement

   Issue C: Landmark fetched but wrong field name in display
   - Fix: Use correct field name (order.delivery_landmark vs order.landmark)

   Issue D: Display logic has condition hiding landmark
   - Fix: Remove or fix conditional rendering

7. TEST WITH FRESH ORDER:
   
   - Have customer place NEW order
   - Use address with obvious landmark: "TEST LANDMARK 123"
   - Check database immediately after order placed
   - Check if landmark appears in rider view
   - Track where data gets lost

8. SHARE LOGS:
   
   Add console.log at every step and share what appears:
   - Order creation: landmark value
   - Database: what's stored
   - Rider query: what's fetched
   - Rider display: what's rendered

Without seeing actual data and logs, we can't identify where the landmark is being lost. Add extensive logging and share the results.
