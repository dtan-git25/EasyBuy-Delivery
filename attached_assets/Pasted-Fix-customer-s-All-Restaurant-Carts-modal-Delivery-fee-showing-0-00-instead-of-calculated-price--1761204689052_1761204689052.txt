Fix customer's All Restaurant Carts modal - Delivery fee showing ₱0.00 instead of calculated price:

PROBLEM:
In the "All Restaurant Carts" modal, delivery fee shows ₱0.00 when it should show the calculated delivery fee based on distance between customer and merchant pin locations.

REQUIRED FIX:

1. Calculate delivery fee for each restaurant cart:
   - Get customer's delivery address coordinates (latitude, longitude)
   - Get each merchant's store coordinates (latitude, longitude)
   - Calculate distance using Haversine formula
   - Apply admin delivery settings (base rate + succeeding rate)
   - Display calculated fee in the cart

2. Show calculated delivery fee:
   Currently showing:
   - Delivery Fee: ₱0.00 ✗
   
   Should show:
   - Delivery Fee: ₱80.00 ✓ (based on actual distance calculation)

3. Calculate when modal opens:
   - As soon as "All Restaurant Carts" modal opens
   - Automatically calculate delivery fee for each merchant in cart
   - Update the display immediately
   - No manual trigger needed

4. Requirements for calculation:
   - Customer must have delivery address with pin location set
   - Merchant must have store location with pin set
   - If either is missing, show: "Set delivery location to calculate fee"

5. Update Grand Total:
   - Include calculated delivery fee in Grand Total
   - Grand Total = Items Total + Delivery Fee + Convenience Fee + Merchant Fee + Markup

6. Apply same calculation as checkout:
   - Use exact same distance calculation logic
   - Use same admin delivery settings
   - Round distance up to whole kilometer
   - Apply: Base Rate (first km) + Succeeding Rate (additional km)

7. For multiple restaurant carts:
   - Calculate delivery fee for EACH restaurant separately
   - Show individual delivery fees per restaurant
   - Sum all delivery fees in "Total for All Carts"

The delivery fee calculation should work exactly the same way it does in checkout modal - using real GPS coordinates and admin settings.
