Fix Rider's Active Order showing delivery fee as 0:

PROBLEM:

In Rider's Active Order card:
- Order total calculation is correct (includes delivery fee)
- But delivery fee line shows: ₱0.00
- Should show actual delivery fee amount

EXAMPLE (INCORRECT):

Order #EBD-12345
Customer: John Doe

Order Items: ₱335.00
Delivery Fee: ₱0.00  ← WRONG (should show ₱70.00)
Multi-Merchant Fee: ₱20.00
Rider's Commission: ₱20.00
Total: ₱445.00  ← Correct total (includes hidden ₱70 delivery fee)

REQUIRED (CORRECT):

Order #EBD-12345
Customer: John Doe

Order Items: ₱335.00
Delivery Fee (2 km): ₱70.00  ← Show actual amount with distance
Multi-Merchant Fee: ₱20.00
Rider's Commission: ₱20.00
Total: ₱445.00

DEBUGGING:

1. CHECK ORDER DATA:
   - Verify delivery_fee is saved in order record
   - Check if delivery_distance is saved
   - Log order data: console.log('Rider order:', order)

2. CHECK DISPLAY:
   - Delivery fee exists in order data?
   - But not displaying in rider view?
   - Field mapping issue?

3. VERIFY DATABASE:
   - Query orders table
   - Check delivery_fee column value
   - Should have actual amount (₱70), not 0

LIKELY CAUSES:

1. Delivery fee calculated but not saved to order
2. Delivery fee saved but not fetched in rider query
3. Delivery fee fetched but wrong field name in display
4. Display using wrong variable (showing 0 instead of actual fee)

FIX:

1. ENSURE DELIVERY FEE IS SAVED:
   When order is created, save:
   - delivery_fee: ₱70.00
   - delivery_distance: 2 (km)
   - These must be stored in orders table

2. FETCH DELIVERY FEE:
   When loading rider's active orders:
   - Include delivery_fee in query
   - Include delivery_distance in query
   - Make sure data is retrieved

3. DISPLAY CORRECTLY:
   In rider's active order card:
   - Show: Delivery Fee (${distance} km): ₱${delivery_fee}
   - Use actual values from order data
   - Not hardcoded 0

The total is correct, which means delivery fee is being included in calculation somewhere, but the display line is showing 0 instead of the actual amount.
