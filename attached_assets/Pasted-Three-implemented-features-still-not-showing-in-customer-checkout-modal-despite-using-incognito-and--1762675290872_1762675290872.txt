Three implemented features still not showing in customer checkout modal despite using incognito and hard refresh:

NOT A CACHE ISSUE - Already confirmed by testing in incognito mode.

LIKELY ISSUES:

1. WRONG COMPONENT FILE EDITED:
   There might be multiple checkout modal components:
   - One for single merchant orders
   - Different one for multi-merchant orders
   - Old/unused component that was edited
   - Active component not updated

   Search the codebase for all files containing "checkout" and "modal" to find which one is actually being used.

2. CHANGES NOT SAVED OR DEPLOYED:
   - Verify files were actually saved after editing
   - Check if Replit auto-saved the changes
   - If production environment, verify deployment happened
   - Check git status to see if changes are committed

3. COMPONENT NOT RE-RENDERING:
   - Changes in code but component uses old data
   - Props not being passed correctly
   - State not updating with new values

4. CONDITIONAL RENDERING HIDING ELEMENTS:
   The elements might be rendered but hidden by conditions:
   - Check if there's an if statement preventing display
   - Look for display: none or hidden classes
   - Check visibility conditions

5. DATA NOT AVAILABLE:
   - Distance/km calculated but not passed to component
   - Multi-merchant fee calculated but not in checkout data
   - Phone number field exists but not populated

DIRECT DEBUGGING STEPS:

1. ADD VISIBLE TEST TEXT:
   In the checkout modal component, add obvious test text:
   - Add "TEST: RECEIVER PHONE NUMBER" instead of label
   - Add "TEST: DELIVERY FEE WITH KM" on delivery line
   - Add "TEST: MULTI MERCHANT FEE HERE" where fee should show
   
   If test text doesn't appear, you're editing wrong file.

2. FIND ACTIVE COMPONENT:
   - Open checkout modal in browser
   - Right-click inspect element on the modal
   - Look at HTML class names or IDs
   - Search codebase for those class names
   - This tells you which component file is actually rendering

3. LOG COMPONENT RENDER:
   At the top of checkout modal component:
   console.log('Checkout modal rendering with data:', checkoutData)
   
   Check if this log appears in console when opening checkout.

4. CHECK FILE PATHS:
   Share the exact file paths you edited:
   - What file did you change for phone number label?
   - What file did you change for delivery km?
   - What file did you change for multi-merchant fee?

5. VERIFY COMPONENT IMPORT:
   The component you edited might not be the one being imported and used.
   Check where checkout modal is called from and which component it imports.

Without seeing which specific files were edited, we're guessing. Please share:
- File names you edited
- Or add obvious test text to verify you're editing the active component
