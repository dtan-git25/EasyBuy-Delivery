Fix rider document viewing issue in admin portal:

PROBLEM:
When rider submits documents for approval (OR/CR, Motor image, ID), admin cannot view them. Clicking the view buttons shows error: {"error":"Document file not found"}

DEBUGGING NEEDED:

1. CHECK FILE UPLOAD:
   - Verify documents are actually being uploaded when rider submits
   - Check if files are saved to storage/filesystem
   - Console log the file paths when rider uploads
   - Verify file upload is working correctly

2. CHECK FILE STORAGE:
   - Where are uploaded files being stored? (public folder, uploads folder, cloud storage?)
   - Are file paths being saved correctly in the database?
   - Check the database column storing document paths
   - Verify the paths are absolute or relative correctly

3. CHECK ADMIN VIEW ENDPOINT:
   - Find the API endpoint that serves document files to admin
   - Example: GET /api/admin/riders/:id/documents/:documentType
   - Add logging to see what file path it's trying to access
   - Log: console.log('Trying to access file:', filePath)

4. COMMON ISSUES:
   - File path saved in database doesn't match actual file location
   - File permissions prevent reading
   - Files uploaded to temp directory that gets cleared
   - Incorrect file path format (missing / or wrong directory)
   - File URL not publicly accessible

5. FIX NEEDED:
   - Ensure uploaded files are saved to persistent storage
   - Save correct file paths/URLs in database
   - Create proper file serving endpoint for admin
   - Set correct file permissions
   - Return file URL or stream file content to admin

6. DATABASE CHECK:
   Query riders table to see what's stored:
   - SELECT or_cr_document, motor_image, id_document FROM riders WHERE id = ?
   - Share what values are stored (file paths/URLs)

7. TEST UPLOAD:
   - Have a rider upload documents
   - Check server console for upload logs
   - Check filesystem to see if files actually saved
   - Check database to see what paths were saved

The issue is either files aren't being uploaded correctly, or the paths aren't being saved/retrieved correctly, or admin doesn't have access to read the files.

Add extensive logging to the upload process and view process to identify where the issue is.
