Three features are implemented but not displaying in customer checkout modal:

ISSUE:
These changes have been implemented in the code but are NOT visible in the customer checkout modal:

1. Contact Number renamed to "Receiver Phone Number"
2. Delivery km not showing in Delivery Fee line
3. Multi-Merchant Fee not appearing for multi-merchant orders

The functionality is working but the UI is not displaying correctly.

DEBUGGING NEEDED:

1. CHECK CHECKOUT MODAL COMPONENT:
   - Find the exact component file that renders customer checkout modal
   - Verify the code changes are in the CORRECT component
   - There might be multiple checkout components (single vs multi-merchant)

2. VERIFY CHANGES ARE IN RIGHT PLACE:
   - Check if you edited the customer checkout modal component
   - Not merchant or rider checkout views
   - Not cart modal (different from checkout modal)

3. CHECK BROWSER CACHE:
   - Clear browser cache completely
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
   - Try in incognito mode
   - The old version might be cached

4. CHECK BUILD/DEPLOYMENT:
   - Verify changes were saved
   - Check if development server restarted
   - If production, verify new code was deployed
   - Check Replit deployment status

5. CONSOLE ERRORS:
   - Open browser console
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Check if component is rendering
   - Any errors preventing display

6. CHECK DATA:
   - Log the checkout data in console
   - Verify distance/km is calculated
   - Verify multi-merchant fee is calculated
   - Check if data exists but just not displaying

7. SPECIFIC CHECKS:

   For "Receiver Phone Number":
   - Search for "Contact Number" text in code
   - Make sure ALL instances are changed
   - Check both single and multi-merchant modals

   For Delivery km:
   - Check if distance variable exists
   - Log: console.log('Distance for display:', distance)
   - Verify it's being passed to the display component

   For Multi-Merchant Fee:
   - Check if fee is calculated
   - Log: console.log('Multi-merchant fee:', multiMerchantFee)
   - Check if conditional display logic is correct

8. CHECK COMPONENT STRUCTURE:
   - Is checkout modal a shared component?
   - Or separate components for single vs multi-merchant?
   - Make sure you edited all necessary components

9. VERIFY CONDITIONAL RENDERING:
   - Check if there's a condition hiding these elements
   - Look for if statements that might be false
   - Check display logic

The changes are likely in the code but either:
- Not in the right component file
- Cached old version showing
- Conditional logic preventing display
- JavaScript error preventing render

Add console logs to verify the data exists and component is rendering with correct values.
