   - Allow reordering via drag-and-drop
   - Or provide up/down arrow buttons
   - Save display order to database

2. DATABASE:
   Store option order in menu items:

   - Values: 1, 2, 3, etc.
   - Lower number displays first

3. CUSTOMER DISPLAY:
   - Fetch options ordered by display_order ASC

   - Visual feedback while dragging
   - Update order numbers on drop

5. ALTERNATIVE - UP/DOWN BUTTONS:
   If drag-and-drop is complex, use simple buttons:

   - [▼] Move down
   - Swap positions with adjacent option

6. DEFAULT ORDER:
   When adding new options, assign order based on:
   - Order they were added
   - Or merchant can set order after adding all options

7. CONSISTENT DISPLAY:
   Show same order in:

   - Add to cart modal
   - Cart display
   - Checkout
   - Order confirmation
   - Order history

This gives merchants control over how customers see and select product options, allowing them to prioritize important options first.
