Add Multi-Merchant Fee that triggers when customer exceeds maximum merchants per order:

ADMIN SETTINGS (Multi-Merchant Checkout Card):

Add two new settings:

1. Maximum Merchants Per Order (Number field)
   Input: [3] merchants
   Description: "Maximum number of different merchants allowed in a single order before additional fee applies"

2. Multi-Merchant Fee (Amount field)
   Input: ₱[20.00]
   Description: "Additional fee charged when customer orders from more than the maximum number of merchants"

LOGIC:

If customer orders from merchants WITHIN limit:
- No additional fee
- Example: Limit is 3, customer orders from 2 merchants → No extra fee

If customer orders EXCEEDS limit:
- Charge multi-merchant fee
- Example: Limit is 3, customer orders from 4 merchants → Add ₱20 fee

CALCULATION EXAMPLES:

Scenario 1 (No Fee):
- Max Merchants: 3
- Customer orders from: Jollibee, McDonald's, KFC (3 merchants)
- Result: No multi-merchant fee

Scenario 2 (Fee Applied):
- Max Merchants: 3
- Multi-Merchant Fee: ₱20
- Customer orders from: Jollibee, McDonald's, KFC, Burger King (4 merchants)
- Result: Add ₱20 multi-merchant fee

CUSTOMER CHECKOUT DISPLAY:

When fee applies, show in order summary:

Items Subtotal: ₱800.00
Delivery Fee: ₱120.00
Multi-Merchant Fee: ₱20.00 (4 merchants - limit: 3)
Convenience Fee: ₱15.00
────────────────────
Total: ₱955.00

Or with explanation:
Multi-Merchant Fee: ₱20.00
(Ordering from 4 merchants. Additional fee applies for orders with more than 3 merchants)

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. ADMIN SETTINGS:
   - Add fields to Multi-Merchant Checkout settings card
   - Save to database: max_merchants_per_order, multi_merchant_fee
   - Both configurable by admin

2. CHECKOUT CALCULATION:
   - Count number of unique merchants in cart
   - Get max_merchants_per_order from settings
   - If merchant_count > max_merchants_per_order:
     * Add multi_merchant_fee to order total
     * Display fee in breakdown

3. DISPLAY LOGIC:
   - Only show fee line if it applies
   - Include merchant count and limit in description
   - Make it clear why fee is charged

4. ORDER RECORD:
   - Save merchant_count with order
   - Save multi_merchant_fee_applied (boolean)
   - Save multi_merchant_fee_amount

5. DISABLE OPTION:
   - If admin sets max to 0 or leaves empty: No limit, no fee
   - If admin sets fee to 0: No fee charged even if over limit

6. VALIDATION:
   - Admin must set both max and fee together
   - Or allow disabling the feature entirely

7. CUSTOMER WARNING:
   Before checkout, show message if over limit:
   "You're ordering from 4 merchants. Orders with more than 3 merchants include a ₱20 multi-merchant fee."

This encourages customers to consolidate orders from fewer merchants while still allowing flexibility with an additional fee for complex orders.
