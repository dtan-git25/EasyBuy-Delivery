Update customer cart and checkout for delivery fee calculation:

1. CART MODAL CHANGES:
   - REMOVE "Delivery Fee" line from cart modal
   - Cart modal should only show:
     * Item list with prices
     * Subtotal
     * "Proceed to Checkout" button
   - Do NOT calculate or display delivery fee in cart

2. CHECKOUT MODAL REQUIREMENTS:
   
   Customer MUST have pin location set:
   - Check if customer has saved address with coordinates (lat, lng)
   - If NO pin location:
     * Show warning: "Please set your delivery location to continue"
     * Display "Set Pin Location" button
     * Open map modal to pin location
     * Cannot proceed to payment without pin location
   - If pin location exists:
     * Allow checkout to proceed
     * Calculate delivery fee

3. DELIVERY FEE CALCULATION IN CHECKOUT:
   
   When checkout modal opens:
   - Get customer coordinates (latitude, longitude)
   - Get merchant coordinates (latitude, longitude)
   - Calculate distance using Haversine formula
   - Get admin settings (base_rate, succeeding_rate)
   - Calculate delivery fee:
```
     roundedDistance = Math.ceil(distance)
     if (roundedDistance <= 1):
       fee = baseRate
     else:
       fee = baseRate + ((roundedDistance - 1) × succeedingRate)
```
   - Display calculated fee in checkout

4. CHECKOUT MODAL DISPLAY:
   
   Delivery Address:
   [Customer's saved address]
   Distance: 3.2 km
   [Edit Address] button
   
   Order Summary:
   Subtotal: ₱500.00
   Delivery Fee (4 km): ₱80.00
   Merchant Fee: ₱20.00
   Convenience Fee: ₱15.00
   Markup: ₱50.00
   ─────────────────────
   TOTAL: ₱665.00
   
   Payment Method:
   ○ Cash on Delivery
   ○ GCash
   ○ Maya
   
   [Place Order] button

5. ADDRESS VALIDATION:
   
   Before showing checkout:
   - Check if customer.address_latitude exists
   - Check if customer.address_longitude exists
   - If missing, block checkout:
```
     Alert: "Delivery location required"
     Message: "Please pin your exact delivery location on the map to calculate delivery fee and proceed with checkout."
     [Set Location Now] button
```

6. EDIT ADDRESS IN CHECKOUT:
   
   If customer clicks "Edit Address":
   - Open map modal with current pin
   - Allow moving pin to new location
   - On save:
     * Update customer address coordinates
     * Recalculate distance
     * Recalculate delivery fee
     * Update checkout total
     * Close map modal
     * Show updated fee immediately

7. MULTIPLE MERCHANTS (if applicable):
   
   If cart has items from multiple merchants:
   - Calculate distance to EACH merchant
   - Calculate separate delivery fee for each
   - Display breakdown:
     * Delivery Fee (Store A - 3km): ₱70.00
     * Delivery Fee (Store B - 5km): ₱90.00
     * Total Delivery: ₱160.00

8. REAL-TIME UPDATES:
   
   Any address change triggers:
   - Immediate distance recalculation
   - Immediate delivery fee update
   - Total amount update
   - No page refresh needed

9. SAVE TO ORDER:
   
   When order is placed, save:
   - customer_delivery_lat
   - customer_delivery_lng
   - merchant_store_lat
   - merchant_store_lng
   - delivery_distance_km (e.g., 3.7)
   - delivery_distance_rounded (e.g., 4)
   - delivery_fee_calculated (e.g., 80.00)
   - base_rate_used (e.g., 50.00)
   - succeeding_rate_used (e.g., 10.00)

10. ERROR HANDLING:
    
    - If merchant has no coordinates: Show error "Store location not available"
    - If customer has no coordinates: Require pin location first
    - If distance calculation fails: Show error, prevent checkout
    - If distance > max delivery radius: "Outside delivery area"

This ensures accurate delivery fee calculation based on real GPS distances only at checkout time, not in the cart.
