Fix Items Subtotal calculation in Admin Earnings History - showing base price instead of customer-paid price:

PROBLEM:

In Admin > Reports > Earnings History, the breakdown shows:

CURRENT (WRONG):
Items Subtotal: ₱50.00 (base price only)
Order Markup (0%): - ₱7.50
Merchant Receives: ₱42.50

This causes mismatch error in verification:
Customer Paid: ₱235.90
Distributed: ₱228.40
Mismatch (highlighted in red)

ISSUE:

Items Subtotal should show what CUSTOMER PAID for items (₱57.50), not the base merchant cost (₱50.00).

CORRECT CALCULATION:

Items Subtotal: ₱57.50 (what customer paid - includes markup)
Order Markup (0%): - ₱7.50 (deducted from customer payment)
Merchant Receives: ₱50.00 (base cost)

Wait, that also doesn't work. Let me recalculate:

If customer paid ₱57.50 for items with ₱7.50 markup:
- Customer paid: ₱57.50
- Markup: ₱7.50
- Base cost: ₱57.50 - ₱7.50 = ₱50.00
- Merchant receives: ₱50.00 ✓

So the display should be:

CUSTOMER PAYMENT:
Items Subtotal: ₱57.50 (amount customer paid for items)
Delivery Fee (0 km): ₱168.40
Rider's Commission: ₱10.00
Total Paid by Customer: ₱235.90

REVENUE DISTRIBUTION:

1. Merchant Earnings:
   Items Customer Paid: ₱57.50
   Order Markup (13%): - ₱7.50
   Merchant Receives: ₱50.00

2. App Earnings:
   Delivery Fee + Multi-Merchant: ₱168.40
   App Share (50%): × 50% = ₱84.20
   Order Markup: + ₱7.50
   Total App Earnings: ₱91.70

3. Rider Earnings:
   Rider's Commission: ₱10.00
   Delivery Pool Share (50%): ₱84.20
   Total Rider Earnings: ₱94.20

VERIFICATION:
Customer Paid: ₱235.90
Distributed: ₱50.00 + ₱91.70 + ₱94.20 = ₱235.90 ✓

FIX REQUIRED:

In the Earnings History breakdown:
- "Items Subtotal" should pull the customer-paid amount (with markup included)
- Currently showing merchant base cost instead
- This throws off the entire calculation display

Update the query/calculation to show:
- Items Subtotal = Sum of item prices customer actually paid (not base merchant cost)
- Then subtract markup to show merchant receives base cost

The data is correct (verification would pass), but the display is showing wrong value for Items Subtotal.
