CRITICAL BUG - Customers are sharing notifications! This is another severe privacy issue.

PROBLEM:
When Customer 1 places an order, Customer 2 also receives notifications about Customer 1's order. All customers are receiving each other's order notifications.

This is a MAJOR privacy and security breach - customers can see other customers' order activities.

ROOT CAUSE:
Notifications are being broadcast to ALL customers instead of only the specific customer who placed the order.

IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED:

1. CHECK NOTIFICATION CREATION:
   When creating notifications for orders, ensure they are targeted to specific users:
   - Order notifications must go ONLY to the customer who placed the order
   - Include customer_id or user_id when creating notification
   - NOT broadcasting to all users of same role

2. CHECK NOTIFICATION FETCHING:
   When a customer views their notifications:
   - Must filter: WHERE user_id = current_customer_id
   - NOT fetching all notifications for role "customer"
   - Only show notifications for that specific logged-in customer

3. CHECK REAL-TIME NOTIFICATIONS:
   If using WebSocket or real-time updates:
   - Notifications must be sent to specific user socket/channel
   - NOT broadcasting to all connected customers
   - Each customer should have their own notification channel

4. VERIFY WHO SHOULD RECEIVE ORDER NOTIFICATIONS:

   When Customer 1 places an order, notifications should go to:
   - Customer 1 (order confirmation, status updates) ✓
   - Merchant (new order alert) ✓
   - Admin (order monitoring) ✓
   - Assigned Rider (when accepted) ✓
   
   Should NOT go to:
   - Customer 2 ✗
   - Customer 3 ✗
   - Any other customers ✗

5. CHECK NOTIFICATION TABLE/SYSTEM:
   - Does notifications table have user_id or customer_id column?
   - Are notifications being saved with correct recipient user_id?
   - Or are they saved without user_id, making them visible to all?

6. FIX BOTH ISSUES TOGETHER:
   This is related to the address sharing bug - both indicate user data is not properly isolated:
   - Addresses not filtered by customer_id
   - Notifications not filtered by user_id
   - General data isolation problem

7. CHECK ALL USER-SPECIFIC DATA:
   Verify these are also properly isolated per customer:
   - Orders (customer should only see their own orders)
   - Cart items (customer should only see their own cart)
   - Payment history
   - Order history
   - Ratings/reviews

8. TEST THE FIX:
   After fixing:
   - Customer A logs in, places order
   - Customer A sees notification ✓
   - Customer B logs in, checks notifications
   - Customer B should NOT see Customer A's order notification ✗
   - Each customer only sees their own notifications

CRITICAL PRIORITY:
These data isolation bugs (shared addresses + shared notifications) indicate a fundamental issue with user data filtering. This MUST be fixed before any production use - this is a serious privacy violation.

All user-specific data must be properly filtered by user_id/customer_id throughout the entire application.
