Fix chatbox order dropdown for multi-merchant orders - show individual order IDs instead of group ID:

PROBLEM:
In chatbox dropdown, multi-merchant orders show only "GROUP-0001" instead of individual order IDs like "EBD-0001", "EBD-0002".

REQUIRED FIX:

Show each individual order in the chatbox dropdown so users can chat about specific merchant orders:

1. CHATBOX DROPDOWN DISPLAY:

Instead of showing:
- GROUP-0001

Show all orders in the group separately:
- EBD-0001 (Jollibee)
- EBD-0002 (McDonald's)
- EBD-0003 (KFC)

2. WHY THIS IS NEEDED:

Multi-merchant orders involve different merchants, so conversations may be specific to one merchant:
- Customer needs to discuss Jollibee order specifically
- Merchant only sees their own order chat
- Rider can chat about specific pickup issues

3. DROPDOWN STRUCTURE:

Active Orders (Chatbox dropdown):
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ EBD-0001 - Jollibee            │
│ EBD-0002 - McDonald's          │
│ EBD-0003 - KFC                 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

Each order is selectable separately for chatting.

4. CHAT PARTICIPANTS PER ORDER:

For Order EBD-0001 (Jollibee):
- Customer
- Jollibee merchant
- Rider
- Admin

For Order EBD-0002 (McDonald's):
- Customer (same person)
- McDonald's merchant (different merchant)
- Rider (same person)
- Admin

Each order has its own chat room/thread.

5. QUERY CHANGE:

Instead of grouping by order_group_id for chat, query individual orders:

Get chat orders for dropdown:
SELECT order_id, merchant_name, status
FROM orders
WHERE rider_id = ? AND status IN ('accepted', 'picked_up', 'in_transit')
ORDER BY created_at DESC

Returns:
- EBD-0001, Jollibee, accepted
- EBD-0002, McDonald's, accepted
- EBD-0003, KFC, accepted

6. CHAT ROOM IDENTIFICATION:

Each chat uses order_id (not order_group_id):
- Chat for EBD-0001 is separate from EBD-0002
- Messages tagged with specific order_id
- Merchant only sees messages for their order_id

7. CUSTOMER VIEW:

Customer sees all their orders from the group:
- Can select EBD-0001 to chat about Jollibee order
- Can select EBD-0002 to chat about McDonald's order
- Different chat threads for different concerns

8. MERCHANT VIEW:

Jollibee merchant only sees:
- EBD-0001 (their order)
- Not EBD-0002 or EBD-0003

McDonald's merchant only sees:
- EBD-0002 (their order)

Each merchant isolated to their own order chat.

9. RIDER VIEW:

Rider sees all orders they're handling:
- EBD-0001 - Jollibee
- EBD-0002 - McDonald's
- EBD-0003 - KFC
- EBD-0004 - Pizza Hut (different customer)
- EBD-0005 - Burger King (different customer)

Can switch between chats for different orders/customers.

10. CHAT TABLE STRUCTURE:

messages table:
- message_id
- order_id (EBD-0001, not GROUP-0001)
- sender_id
- sender_role
- message_text
- timestamp

This allows filtering messages per specific order.

11. BENEFITS:

- Specific conversations per merchant order
- Merchant privacy (can't see other merchants' chats)
- Clear context for each conversation
- Easier issue resolution per order
- Better organization for multi-merchant scenarios

The key change: Use individual order_id for chat identification instead of order_group_id, while still treating the delivery as one job for the rider's acceptance and capacity.
