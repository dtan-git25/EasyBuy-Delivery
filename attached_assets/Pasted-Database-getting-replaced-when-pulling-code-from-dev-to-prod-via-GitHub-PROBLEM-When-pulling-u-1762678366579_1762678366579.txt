Database getting replaced when pulling code from dev to prod via GitHub:

PROBLEM:
When pulling updates from dev to prod through GitHub, the production database is being replaced with the development database. Only code should update, not the database.

SOLUTION:

1. EXCLUDE DATABASE FROM GIT:
   
   Add database files to .gitignore so they're never committed:
   
   In .gitignore file, add:
   - *.db
   - *.sqlite
   - *.sqlite3
   - database.db
   - /db/*.db
   - Any database file patterns used

2. USE SEPARATE DATABASES:
   
   Dev and Prod should use completely separate databases:
   
   Development:
   - Database: dev_database.db or hosted dev database
   - Contains test data, can be reset anytime
   
   Production:
   - Database: prod_database.db or hosted prod database
   - Contains real customer data, never replaced
   
   Use environment variables to specify which database to use.

3. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
   
   In Dev Repl:
   DATABASE_URL=path/to/dev_database.db
   
   In Prod Repl:
   DATABASE_URL=path/to/prod_database.db
   
   Code uses process.env.DATABASE_URL to connect

4. CHECK .GITIGNORE:
   
   Verify .gitignore includes database files:
   - Check if database files are listed
   - If missing, add them now
   - Remove database from git tracking if already committed

5. REMOVE DATABASE FROM GIT HISTORY:
   
   If database was already committed:
   - Remove from git tracking: git rm --cached database.db
   - Commit the removal
   - Database stays locally but not in repo

6. VERIFY WORKFLOW:
   
   Correct process:
   - Make code changes in Dev
   - Commit and push to GitHub (code only, no database)
   - Pull in Prod from GitHub
   - Prod code updates, Prod database unchanged
   
   Wrong process:
   - Database included in git commits
   - Prod pulls and database gets replaced
   - Prod loses real customer data

7. MIGRATIONS ONLY:
   
   If database schema changes:
   - Create migration scripts
   - Run migrations in both Dev and Prod separately
   - Never copy entire database

8. BACKUP PROD DATABASE:
   
   Before any update:
   - Backup production database
   - Store backup safely
   - Can restore if something goes wrong

9. CHECK WHAT'S BEING COMMITTED:
   
   Before pushing from Dev:
   - Run: git status
   - Check what files are staged
   - Ensure no database files listed
   - Only code files should be committed

This ensures production data is never overwritten when deploying code updates.
