Add map pin location feature for Merchant registration and profile:

Implement the same map functionality for merchants as customers have:

1. MERCHANT REGISTRATION FORM:
   - Add "Store Location" section
   - Include interactive map for pinning store address
   - "Use Current Location" button
   - Draggable marker on map
   - Auto-fill address fields from pin location

2. MERCHANT PROFILE/SETTINGS:
   - Allow editing store location
   - Show current pin location on map
   - Update store coordinates when pin is moved
   - Save new location to merchant profile

3. MAP FEATURES FOR MERCHANTS:
   
   Same functionality as customer map:
   - Interactive map (Leaflet or Google Maps)
   - Click to place pin
   - Drag pin to adjust location
   - "Use Current Location" button (GPS)
   - Reverse geocoding (coordinates â†’ address)
   - Map height: 400px
   - Default center: Manila or last known location
   - Zoom level: 15 (closer zoom for store accuracy)

4. ADDRESS FORM INTEGRATION:
   
   When pin is placed/moved:
   - Capture latitude and longitude
   - Update address fields automatically:
     * Street/Building
     * Barangay
     * City
     * Province
     * Postal Code
   - Allow manual editing if auto-fill is incorrect

5. STORE DATABASE FIELDS:
   Add to merchants/stores table:
   - store_latitude (decimal)
   - store_longitude (decimal)
   - store_address_full (text)
   - store_city (text)
   - last_location_update (timestamp)

6. USE CASES:
   
   For customers:
   - Calculate accurate distance to store
   - Show store location on map
   - Calculate delivery fees based on real distance
   
   For riders:
   - Navigate to exact store location
   - Multiple store pickups with accurate routing

7. VALIDATION:
   - Pin location is required during registration
   - Cannot submit without setting store location
   - Verify coordinates are within service area (Philippines)
   - Show warning if location seems unusual

8. DISPLAY STORE LOCATION:
   - Show store pin on customer's restaurant browsing map
   - Display distance from customer to each merchant
   - "View on Map" button in merchant profile

This ensures accurate store locations for distance calculations, delivery fees, and rider navigation.
