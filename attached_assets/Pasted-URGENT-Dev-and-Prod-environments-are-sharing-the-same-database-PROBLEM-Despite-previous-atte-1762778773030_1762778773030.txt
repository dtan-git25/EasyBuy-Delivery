URGENT - Dev and Prod environments are sharing the same database:

PROBLEM:
Despite previous attempts to separate databases, development and production Repls are still using the same database. Changes in dev immediately affect prod and vice versa.

REQUIRED FIX:

1. VERIFY DATABASE FILES:
   Check which database file each environment is using:
   - In Dev: Check database file path
   - In Prod: Check database file path
   - They should be DIFFERENT files

2. CREATE SEPARATE DATABASE FILES:
   
   Development:
   - Use: dev_database.db or easybuy_dev.db
   
   Production:
   - Use: prod_database.db or easybuy_prod.db

3. UPDATE DATABASE CONNECTION:
   
   In the database connection code, use environment variable:
   
   Check process.env.NODE_ENV to determine which database to use:
   - If NODE_ENV === 'development': use dev database
   - If NODE_ENV === 'production': use prod database
   
   Or use DATABASE_URL environment variable directly

4. SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
   
   In Dev Repl Secrets:
   NODE_ENV = development
   DATABASE_URL = ./dev_database.db
   
   In Prod Repl Secrets:
   NODE_ENV = production
   DATABASE_URL = ./prod_database.db

5. VERIFY DATABASE FILE LOCATION:
   
   Make sure database files are:
   - NOT in git repository (check .gitignore includes *.db)
   - Stored locally in each Repl
   - Never synced between environments

6. CHECK DATABASE CONNECTION CODE:
   
   Find where database connection is initialized
   - Verify it reads from environment variable
   - Confirm it uses correct database path based on environment
   - Add logging: console.log('Using database:', databasePath)

7. TEST SEPARATION:
   
   After fix:
   - Create test data in Dev (e.g., test customer)
   - Check Prod - should NOT see test customer
   - Create different test in Prod
   - Check Dev - should NOT see prod test data
   - Databases are properly isolated

8. CURRENT WORKAROUND:
   
   Until fixed, be extremely careful:
   - Don't test in Dev if it affects Prod
   - Don't delete data in either environment
   - All test data appears in production!

This is critical - dev testing is corrupting production data. Must be fixed immediately before any real customers use the system.
