Three updates for Customer portal:

1. ADD "NONE" OPTION TO ALL CUSTOMIZATION TYPES:

When customer customizes menu item order:
- For EVERY option type that merchant added (Size, Flavor, Add-ons, etc.)
- Automatically include "None" as the first option
- Customer can choose to skip that customization

Example:
Merchant added for Fries:
- Size: Small (₱50), Large (₱75)
- Add-ons: Extra Cheese (₱20), Bacon (₱25)

Customer sees:
Size:
○ None (₱0)
○ Small (₱50)
○ Large (₱75)

Add-ons:
□ None (₱0)
□ Extra Cheese (₱20)
□ Bacon (₱25)

Implementation:
- "None" option should have ₱0 price
- "None" should be pre-selected by default for optional customizations
- If customization is required (merchant marked as required), "None" can be disabled or hidden
- For radio button options (single choice): "None" is first option
- For checkboxes (multiple choice): "None" checkbox available

Price calculation:
- If customer selects "None", add ₱0 to item price
- If customer selects actual option, add that option's price
- Display total: Base price + selected options

2. REMOVE DELIVERY FEE FROM CART MODAL:

Cart Modal should show:
✓ Item list with quantities and prices
✓ Item customizations (if any)
✓ Subtotal (items only)
✓ "Proceed to Checkout" button
✗ NO Delivery Fee line
✗ NO Merchant Fee line
✗ NO Convenience Fee line
✗ NO Total with fees

Keep cart simple - just items and subtotal.

3. DELIVERY FEE CALCULATION IN CHECKOUT MODAL:

Checkout Modal Requirements:
- Customer MUST have delivery address with pin location (lat, lng)
- If no pin location saved:
  * Show alert: "Please set your delivery location first"
  * Show "Add/Edit Address" button
  * Require map pin placement
  * Cannot proceed without pin location

Calculate delivery fee when checkout opens:
- Get customer coordinates (from selected delivery address)
- Get merchant coordinates (from store location)
- Use Haversine formula to calculate distance in km
- Get admin settings: base_rate (first km), succeeding_rate (per km)
- Apply formula:
```
  roundedDistance = Math.ceil(actualDistance)
  if (roundedDistance <= 1):
    deliveryFee = baseRate
  else:
    deliveryFee = baseRate + ((roundedDistance - 1) × succeedingRate)
```

Checkout Modal Display:

Delivery Address:
[Customer Address]
📍 Distance: 3.2 km (4 km rounded)
[Edit Address]

Order Summary:
Items Subtotal: ₱500.00
Delivery Fee (4 km): ₱80.00

Real-time updates:
- If customer edits address/changes pin location
- Recalculate distance immediately
- Update delivery fee
- Update total
- No page refresh needed

Save to order:
- delivery_distance_km (actual: 3.2)
- delivery_distance_rounded (4)
- delivery_fee (80.00)
- customer_lat, customer_lng
- merchant_lat, merchant_lng
- base_rate_applied (50.00)

These three changes improve customization flexibility, simplify cart view, and ensure accurate delivery fee calculation based on real GPS coordinates.
